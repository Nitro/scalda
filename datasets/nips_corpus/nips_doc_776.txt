Abstract 
Solvable models of nonlinear lem'ning machines m'e proposed, and 
learning in artificial neural networks is studied based on the theory 
of ordinary differential equations. A learning algorithm is con- 
structed, by which the optimal parameter can be found without 
any recursive procedure. The solvable models enable us to analyze 
the reason why experimental results by the error backpropagation 
often contradict the statistical learning theory. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Recent studies have shown that learning in artificial neural networks can be under- 
stood as statistical parametric estimation using the maxbnum likelihood method 
[1], and that their generalization abilities can be estimated using the statistical 
asymptotic theory [2]. However, as is often reported, even when the number of 
parameters is too large, the error for the testing sample is not so large as the theory 
predicts. The reason for such inconsistency has not yet been clarified, because it is 
difficult for the artificial neural network to find the global optimal parameter. 
On the other hand, in order to analyze the nonlinear phenomena, exactly solvable 
models have been playing a central role in mathematical physics, for example, the 
K-dV equation, the Toda lattice, and some statistical models that satisfy the Yang- 
423 
424 Watanabe 
Baxter equation[3]. 
This paper proposes the first solvable models in the nonlinear learning problem. We 
consider simple three-layered neural networks, and show that the parameters from 
the inputs to the hidden units determine the function space that is characterized 
by a differential equation. This fact means that optimization of the parameters 
is equivalent to optimization of the differential equation. Based on this property, 
we construct a learning algorithm by which the optimal parameters can be found 
without any recursive procedure. Experimental result using the proposed algorithm 
shows that the maximum likelihood estimator is not always obtained by the error 
backpropagation, and that the conventional statistical learning theory leaves much 
to be improved. 
2 The Basic Structure of Solvable Models 
Let us consider a function fc,w(X) given by a simple neural network with 1 input 
unit, H hidden units, and 1 output unit, 
H 
fc,w(x) -  ciTw(x), (1) 
i=1 
where both c -- {ci} and tv -- {wi} are parameters to be optimized, Tw,(x) is the 
output of the i-th hidden unit. 
;e assume that {i(x) -- w,(X) is a set of independent functions in CH-class. 
The following theorem is the start point of this paper. 
Theorem 1 
Iution is {T(x) and whose H-th order coefficient is I is uniquely given by 
(Owg)(x) = (-1) W,+ (g, 1, 2, ..., H 
where I/VH is the H-th order Wronskian,

Corollary I Let g(x) be a CH-class function. Then the following conditions for 
g(x) and w = {wi} are equivalent.

(2) = O.

Example 1 Let us consider a case, Ow,(X) = exp0v,x). 
H 
g(x) =  c, exp(w,x) 
i=1 
is equivalent to {D n + pD n- + p2D n-2 +...+pn}g(x) = 0, where D = (d/dx) 
and a set {pi} is determined from {wi} by the relation, 
H 
z +z -1 +pz - +...+p, = (z-w,) (Vz  c). 
i:1 
Example 2 (RBF) A hnction g(x) is given by radial bis functions, 
H 
g(x) =  ci exp{-(x- wi)2}, 
i=1 
if and only if e-'{D n +pD n- +p2D n-2 +...+pn}(e'g(x)) = 0, where aset 
{pi} is deternfined from {wi} by the relation, 
H 
z +pz - +p-+...+p,, = (z- 2,) (Vz c). 
i=1 
Figure 1 shows a learning algorithm for the solvable models. When a target function 
g(x) is given, let us consider the following function approximation problem. 
H 
(') =  m,() + (). 
i=1 
Learning in the neural network is optinfizing both {ci} and {wi} such that (x) is 
minimized for some error function. From the definition of D, eq. (3) is equivMent 
to (Dmg)(z) = (D)(x), where the term (Dwg)(z) is independent of ci. Therefore, 
if we adopt IID11 s the error function to be minimized, {wi} is optimized by 
minimizing IIDgll, independenfiy of {ci}, where I111  = f I()ld. After 
is mininfized, we have (Dm.g)(z)  0, where w* is the optimized parameter. From 
the corollary 1, there exists a set {c} such that g(x)   cm(z), where {c} 
can be found using the ordinary least square method. 
3 Solvable Models 
For a general function Tw, the differential operator Dw does not always have such 
a simple form as the above examples. In this section, we consider a linear operator 
L such that the differential equation of Lw has a simple form. 
Definition A neural network  cioi (x) is called solvable if there exist functions 
a, b, and a linear operator L such that 
(Lpw,)(x) = exp(a(tvi)x + bOvi)). 
The following theore,n shows that the optimal parmneter of the solvable models can 
be found using the same algo,'ithm as Figure 1.

Theorem 2 For a solvable model of a neural network, the .following conditions are 
equivalent when wi  wj (i  j). 
(1) There exist both {ci} and {wi} such that g(x) - iH= CiTw,(X). 
(2) There exists {Pl} such that {D t + pD t- + p2D t-2 +... + pt}(Lg)(x)= O. 
(3) For arbitrary Q > O, we define a sequence {yn} by y, = (Lg)(nQ). Then, there 
exists {qi} such that Yn + qlYn- + q2Yn-2 + ' + qHYn-H = O. 
Note that {IDwLgll 2 is a quadratic form for {pi}, xvhich is easily nfininfized by the 
least square method. 'n lY' + qlY,- +' + qHY,-Y{ 2 is also a quadratic form for

relations.

The sequences {wi), {Pi), and {qi} in the theorem 2 have the following 
q- p2z H-2 q- � .. q- P, 
z t + qz It- + q2z ti-2 + ' + qIt = 
H 
I-I(z -- a(wi)) (Vz  C), 
i=1 
H 
1-I(z- exp(a(wi)Q)) (Vz  C).

For proofs of the above theorelns, see [5]. These theorems sho,v that, if {Pi} or 
Solvable Models of Artificial Neural Networks 427 
{qi) is optimized for a given function g(x), then {a(wi)} can be found as a set of 
solutions of the algebraic equation. 
Suppose that a target function g(x) is given. Then, from the above theorems, 
the globally optimal parameter w* = {w r } can be found by mininfizing 
independently of {ci}. Moreover, if the hnction a(w) is a one-to-one mapping, then 
there exists w* uniquely without permutation of {w }, if and only if the quadratic 
form II{D + p DH- + ' + p-}gll 2 is not degenerate[4]. (Remk that, if it is 
degenerate, we can use another neural network with the smMler number of hidden 
units.) 
Example 3 A neurM network without scMing

is solvable when (a)(x)  0 (a.e.), where  denotes the Fourier transform. Define 
a linear operator L by (Lg)(x)= (g)(x)/(a)(x), then, it follows that 
H 
(Lf,,c)(X) =  ci exp(- bi x). (5)

By the Theorem 2, the optimM {hi} can be obtMned by using the differentiM or the 
sequential equation.

Define a linear operator L by (Lg)(x) = x. (g)(x), then, it folloxvs 
H 
(Lfb,c)(X) =  ciexp(-(ai + V/ bi)x + (ai, bi)) (x >_ 0). (7) 
i=1 
where o(ai, hi) is some function of ai and hi. Since the function tan -l(x) is mono- 
tone increasing and bounded, we can expect that a neural network given by eq. 
(6) has the same ability in the function approximation problem as the ordinary 
three-layered perceptton using the sigmoid function, tanh(x).

H 
(Lfb,c)(X) = y. ciexp(--(ai + vf bi)x + t(al,bi)) (x _> 0). (9)

where (ai, bi) is some function of ai and b. Note that a(x) is an analyzing wavelet, 
and that this example shows a method how to optimize parameters for the finite 
wavelet decomposition. 
4 Learning Algorithm 
We construct a learning algorithm for solvable models, as shown in Figure 1. 
< <Learning Algorithm> > 
(0) A target function g(x) is given. 
(1) {Ym} is calculated by Ym - (Lg)(mQ). 
(2) {qi} is optimized by mininfizing Y']m lyre + qlYm- q- q2Ym-2 q-' q- qHYm-H[ 2. 
(3) {Zi} is calculated by solving z H + qlz -1 + q2 zH-2 q-... q- qH -- O. 
(4) {ivi} is determined by a(wi)= (1/Q)log zi. 
(5) {ci} is optimized by minimizing Yj(g(xj)- Yicio,(xj)) 2. 
Strictly speaking, g(x) should be given for arbitrary x. However, in the practical 
application, if the number of training samples is sufficiently large so that (Lg)(x) 
can be ahnost precisely approximated, this algorithm is available. In the third 
procedure, to solve the algebraic equation, the DKA method is applied, for example. 
5 Experimental Results and Discussion 
5.1 The backpropagation and the proposed method 
For experiments, we used a probability density function and a regression function 
given by 
i exp(- (y - h(x))2 
Q(y]x)- 2 2 2 2 ) 
I tan_(x - 1/3 i tan_(x - 2/3 
= ' + 0.02 ) 
where rr = 0.2. One hundred input samples were set at the same interval in [0,1), 
and output samples were taken from the above conditional distribution.
