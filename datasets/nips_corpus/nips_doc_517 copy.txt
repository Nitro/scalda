Abstract 
We present experimental data from an analog CMOS LSI chip that im- 
plements the Herault-Jutten adaptive neural network. Testing procedures 
and results in time and frequency-domain are described. These include 
weight convergence trajectories, extraction of a signal in noise, and sepa- 
ration of statistically complex signals such as speech. 
I Introduction 
In its most general form, the N x N independent component analyzer (In.C.A.) net- 
work (Herault 1986, Jutten 1987, 1991) can be used to solve the following classical 
signal processing problem; given N physically distinct measurements of a priori 
unknown linear combinations of N independent signal sources, the network auto- 
adaptively extracts N equivalent independent signals. 
The network consists of a set of N simple processing units interconnected by in- 
hibitory synapses (see figure 1). A processing unit i calculates its output Si(t) 
based on its input Ei(t) and the weighted sum of the outputs from the remaining 
N - 1 units. The weights are updated using a modified Hebbian learning rule (Hebb 
1949, Herault 1986, Jutten 1987, 1991). 
This architecture has led to various CMOS implementations (Vittoz 1989, Cohen 
1991a). We have implemented three different CMOS designs using different learn-

ing rules, circuits and design methodologies. Two of them employ both above- 
and below-threshold CMOS circuits, the third (Cohen 1991a, 1992) employs only 
subthreshold MOS technology. The particulars of the circuits and learning rules 
employed in our implementations have been described in detail elsewhere (Cohen 
1991a, 1991b, 1991c, 1992); this paper concentrates on the test procedures and 
results using different type of input signals. 
In section 2 we describe the test procedure used to observe the evolution of the 
weights in time from reset to convergence of the network. In section 3 we describe 
tests designed to observe the frequency domain characteristics of the network. In 
section 4 we describe more ambitious tests involving speech signals and other audio- 
band signals. 
All results presented here were obtained from the first design: a chip that used 
the learning rules and design techniques of Vittoz and Arreguit (Vittoz 1989). Our 
improvements on their original implementation were mostly in the details of the 
circuits and resulted in a system that had less systematic offsets in the individual 
components (Cohen 1991a). However, similar tests where performed on the other 
two designs with similar results. 
2 Time domain results 
This test was chosen to match conditions used for digital simulations of the network, 
and to compare the evolution of the weights in their weight-space. Two sine waves 
of approximately lkHz were mixed in two different ratios, and the mixed signals 
(El and Es) were presented to the chip. The chip output signals ($1 and $2) and 
the weights (Cl and Cl) were digitized and plotted. 
The results are shown in figure 2. Figure 2(a) is a phase plot of the network's input 
signals, and figure 2(b) is a phase plot of the network's output signals after

convergence of the weights: note how the plot has been transformed from a parallel- 
ogram into a rectangle. Figure 2(c) is a plot of the network's weights as a function 
of time, beginning from the reset state where the weight capacitors are grounded. 
Figure 2(d) is a phase plot of the network's weights: in this instance, the initial 
808 Cohen, Pouliquen, and Andreou 
rapid change in the phase space of the weights is due to offsets in the circuits used. 
That is, once the system was turned on it assumed an operating point for weights 
other than the (0,0). Figures 2(e) and 2(f) plot the output signals of the network 
immediately after reset and after convergence of the weights respectively. Other 
implementations exhibited similar behaviors except that initial offsets in the weight 
space (although certainly not catastrophic here) were eliminated by using improved 
circuit techniques. 
This test is not applied to larger networks due to the large number of signals required 
to observe the weights. By comparing the convergence results of the 2 x 2 networks 
for which the weights were externally observable with other networks for which the 
weights were not observable, it was determined that the addition of the observation 
circuitry slowed convergence by a factor of 5. 
3 Frequency domain results 
This procedure is designed to test an implementation's ability to extract a signal 
which is buried in background noise. 
The signal (X1, a sinusoid) is to be extracted from bandpass filtered white noise 
(X2), which has peak amplitude 10dB greater than the signal and center frequency 
around the frequency of the signal. 
Test results are plotted in figure 3: the magnitude spectrum of the original signals, 
the input signals to the network, and the output signals of the network after con- 
vergence are shown. The chip is able to reduce the background noise by 30dB, and 
extract the sinusoid. 
Larger networks (6 x 6) were tested with a mixture of six sinusoidal signals around 
lkHz spaced at not regular intervals approximately 20Hz apart. The networks 
successfully separated each pure sinusold into a separate output channel and sup- 
pressed all adjacent sinusoids by approximately 20dB. No convergence problems 
were encountered with this larger network. 
4 Audio-band results 
These In.C.A. networks were not necessarily intended for filtering the type of signals 
that are usually synthesized in a laboratory. Therefore the networks were also tested 
using music and speech, signals that have more complex statistical properties. 
For instance, a recording of a segment of text read in English and a segment of 
text read in greek by the same speaker were mixed in two slightly different ratios 
to produce unintelligible input signals for the 2 x 2 networks. The spectrogram of 
a typical segment of the mixed signals is shown in figure 4. The networks easily 
recovered the two original recordings: the spectrograms of the outputs are shown

in figure 5. Similar results were obtained with mixed recordings of music, or com- 
binations of music and speech. 
5 Conclusion 
We have described the results of a network which performs auto-adaptive filtering. 
By using analog VLSI technology we have achieved a real-time, scalable and low

power realization of the network. We believe it will have many applications, to 
name but a few; 
� three dimensional object reconstruction from stereoscopic vision, 
� removing crosstalk in telephone/digital communication lines, and 
� separation of evoked potential signals from background EEG and EMG noise. 
Using MOS technology and micropower techniques real-time separation of signals 
in the audio spectrum and up to about 1MHz is possible. Current-mode techniques 
(Cohen 1992) using bipolar devices, and higher current levels should enable real- 
time processing of signals of a few hundred MHz. 
Future work will involve developing the capability to handle signal delays introduced 
by the medium through which the signals propagate before reaching the sensors (as

in the cocktail party problem). Such modifications to the algorithm have been 
proposed by Jutten (Jutten 1987) and recently by Platt and Faggin (Platt 1991).
