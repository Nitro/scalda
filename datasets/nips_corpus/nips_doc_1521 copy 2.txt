Abstract 
We present an analog VLSI cellular architecture implementing a simpli- 
-fled version of the Boundary Contour System (BCS) for real-time image 
processing. Inspired by neuromorphic models across several layers of 
visual cortex, the design integrates in each pixel the functions of sim- 
ple cells, complex cells, hyper-complex cells, and bipole cells, in three 
orientations interconnected on a hexagonal grid. Analog current-mode 
CMOS circuits are used throughout to perform edge detection, local inhi- 
bition, directionally selective long-range diffusive kernels, and renormal- 
izing global gain control. Experimental results from a fabricated 12 x 10 
pixel prototype in 1.2/zm CMOS technology demonstrate the robustness 
of the architecture in selecting image contours in a cluttered and noisy 
background. 
1 Introduction 
The Boundary Contour System (BCS) and Feature Contour System (FCS) combine models 
for processes of image segmentation, feature filling, and surface reconstruction in biolog- 
ical vision systems [1],[2]. They provide a powerful technique to recognize patterns and 
restore image quality under excessive fixed pattern noise, such as in SAR images [3]. A 
related model with similar functional and structural properties is presented in [4]. 
The motivation for implementing a relatively complex model such as BCS and FCS on 
the focal-plane is dual. First, as argued in [5], complex neuromorphic active pixel designs 
become viable engineering solutions as the feature size of the VLSI technology shrinks 
significantly below the optical diffraction limit, and more transistors can be stuffed in each 
pixel. The pixel design that we present contains 88 transistors, likely the most complex

active pixel imager ever put on silicon. Second, our motivation is to extend the functionality 
of previous work on analog VLSI neuromorphic image processors for image boundary 
segmentation, e.g. [6, 7, 5, 8, 9] which are based on simplified physical models that do not 
include directional selectivity and/or long-range signal aggregation for boundary formation 
in the presence of significant noise and clutter. The analog VLSI implementation of BCS 
reported here is a first step towards this goal, with the additional objectives of real-time, 
low-power operation as required for demanding target recognition applications. As an 
alternative to focal-plane optical input, the image can be loaded electronically through 
random-access pixel addressing. 
The BCS model encompasses visual processing at different levels, including several lay- 
ers of cells interacting through shunting inhibition, long-range cooperative excitation, and 
renormalization. The implementation architecture, shown schematically in Figure 1, parti- 
tions the BCS model into three levels: simple cells, complex and hypercomplex cells, and 
bipole cells. 
Simple cells compute unidirectional gradients of normalized intensity obtained from the 
photoreceptors. Complex (hyper-complex) cells perform spatial and directional compe- 
tition (inhibition) for edge formation. Bipole cells perform long-range cooperation for 
boundary contour enhancement, and exert positive feedback (excitation) onto the hyper- 
complex cells. Our present implementation does not include the FCS model, which com- 
pletes and fills features through diffusive spatial filtering of the image blocked by the edges 
formed in BCS. 
2 Modified BCS Algorithm and Implementation 
We adopted the BCS algorithm for analog continuous-time implementation on a hexagonal 
grid, extending in three directions u, v and w on the focal plane as indicated schematically 
in Figure 2. For notational convenience, let subscript 0 denote the center pixel and +u, +v 
and +w its six neighbors. Components of each complex cell vector Ci at grid location i, 
along three directions of edge selectivity, are indicated with superscript indices u, v and w. 
In the implemented circuit model, a pixel unit consists of a photosensor (or random-access 
analog memory) sourcing a current indicating light intensity, gradient computation and 
rectification circuits implementing simple cells in three directions, and one complex (hyper-

complex) cell and one bipole cell for each of the three directions. 
The photosensors generate a current Ii that is proportional to intensity. Through current 
mirrors, the currents Ii propagate in the three directions u, v, and w as noted in Figure 
2. Rectified finite-difference gradient estimates of Ii are obtained for each of the three 
hexagonal directions. These gradients excite the complex cells 6'. 
Lateral inhibition among spatially (i) and directionally (j) adjacent complex cells imple- 
ment the function of hypercomplex cells for edge enhancement and noise reduction. The 
complex output (C'{) is inhibited by local complex cell outputs in the two competing direc- 
tions of j. Co is additionally inhibited by the complex cells of the four nearest neighbors 
in competing locations i with parallel orientation. 
A directionally selective interconnected diffusive network of bipole cells B, interacting 
with the complex cells C', provides long range cooperative feedback, and enhances smooth 
edge contours while reducing spurious edges due to image clutter. C' is excited by bipole 
interaction received from the bipole cell B on the line crossing i in the same direction j. 
The operation of the (hyper-)complex cells in the hexagonal arrangement is summarized in 
the following equation, for one of the three directions u: 
II(Iv + Lo) - Io - a(6' 
C=5 
where:

1. [ + Lo) - Io[ represents the rectified gradient input as approximated on the 
hexagonal grid; 
2. a(6' + 6' �) is the inhibition from locally opposing directions; 
3. a (6' + 6' + 6'_v + 6'_o) is inhibition from non-aligned neighbors in the same 
direction; and 
4. /3B is the excitation through long-range cooperation from the bipole cell.

where K, K, and K represent spatial convolutional kernels implementing bipole fields 
symmetrically polarized in the u, v and w directions. Diffusive kernels can be efficiently 
implemented with a distributed representation using resistive diffusive elements [7, 10]. 
Three linear networks of diffusor elements are used, complemented with cross-links of 
adjustable strength, to control the degree of direction selectivity and the spatial spread 
of the kernel. Finally, the result (2) is locally normalized, before it is fed back onto the 
complex cells. 
3 Analog VLSI Implementation 
The simplified circuit diagram of the BCS cell, including simple, complex and bipole cell 
functions on a hexagonal grid, is shown in Figure 4. 
The image is acquired either optically from phototransistors on the focal-plane, or in direct 
electronic format through random-access pixel addressing, Figure 4 (a). The simple cell 
portion in Figure 4 (b) combines the local intensity I0 with intensities Ivand Lo received 
from neighboring cells to compute the rectified gradient in (1), using distributed current 
mirrors and an absolute value circuit. A pMOS load converts the complex cell output into 
a voltage representation C' for distribution to neighboring nodes and complementary ori- 
entations: local inhibition for spatial and directional competition in Figure 4 (c), and long- 
range cooperation through the bipole layer in Figure 4 (d). The linear diffusive kernel is 
implemented in current-mode using ladder structures of subthreshold MOS transistors [7], 
three families extending in each direction with cross-links for directional dispersion as in- 
dicated in Figure 3. 
Voltage biases control the spatial extent and directional selectivity of the interactions, as
