Abstract 
We describe a model of visual word recognition that accounts for 
several aspects of the temporal processing of sequences of briefly 
presented words. The model utilizes a new representation for writ- 
ten words, based on dynamic time warping and multidimensional 
scaling. The visual input passes through cascaded perceptual, com- 
parison, and detection stages. We describe how these dynamical 
processes can account for several aspects of word recognition, in- 
cluding repetition priming and repetition blindness. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Several psychological phenomena show that the construction of organized and mean- 
ingful representations of the visual environment requires establishing separate repre- 
sentations (termed episodic representations) for the different objects viewed. Three 
phenomena in the word recognition literature suggest that the segregation of the 
visual flow into separate episodic representations can be characterized in terms of 
specific temporal constraints. We developed a model to explore the nature of these 
constraints. 
2 DESCRIPTION OF THE BEHAVIORAL DATA 
In a typical priming experiment, subjects are presented with a first word, termed 
the prime, and then asked to name or make a judgment to a second word, termed 
879 
880 Bavelier and Jordan 
the target. The performance of subjects is compared in conditions in which the 
target and prime are related versus conditions in which they are unrelated. 
When the prime is presented fast enough so that, it cannot be identified (about 
40 ms), subjects' performance on the target is facilitated when the prime and the 
target are identical compared to the case in which they are unrelated. This effect, 
known as masked priming, is very short lasting, appearing only within trials, 
and lasting on the order of 100 ms (Humphreys, Evett, Quinlan & Besner, 1987). 
If the prime, however, is presented for a period such that it is just identifiable (about 
100 ms), subjects' peribrmance on the target is hindered when prime and target 
are identical (Kanwisher, 1987; Humphreys et al., 1987). This effect, known as 
repetition blindness, is conditional on the conscious identification of the prime. 
The size of the effect decreases as the duration between the two items increases. 
Repetition blindness is observed only within trials and vanishes for inter-stimulus 
durations on the order of 500 ms. 
When the prime is presented long enough to be easily identifiable (about 250 ms or 
more), subjects' performance on the target is once again facilitated when prime and 
target are identical (Salasoo, Shiftfin & Feustel, 1985). This effect, known as clas- 
sical repetition priming, is long lasting, being observed not only within trials, 
but between trials and even between sessions. In certain experimental conditions, 
it has been observed to last up to a year. 
These results implicate two factors influencing word recognition: the time of pre- 
sentation and whether or not the prime has been identified. We have developed a 
model that captures the rather non-intuitive result that as the time of presentation 
of the prilne increases, recall of the target is first facilitated, then inhibited and then 
facilitated again. The two main features of the model are the dynamical properties 
of the word representations and the dependence of the detection processes for each 
word on previous conscious identification of that word. 
3 REPRESENTATION 
The representation that we developed for our model is a vector space representation 
that allows each word to be represented by a fixed-length vector, even though the 
words are of different length. We developed an algorithmic method for finding the 
word representations that avoids some of the difficulties with earlier proposals (cf. 
Pinker & Prince, 1988). 
The algorithm proceeds in three stages. First, dynamic programming (Bellman, 
1957) is used to compute an inter-word similarity matrix. The transition costs in 
the dynamic programming procedure were based on empirically-determined values 
of visual similarity between individual letters (Townsend, 1971). Interestingly, we 
found that dynamic programming solutions naturally capture several factors that 
are known to be important in human sensitivity to orthographic similarity (for ex- 
ample, orthographic priming increases as a function of the number of letters shared 
between the prime and the target in a nonlinear manner, shared end-letters are 
more important than shared middle-letters, and relative letter position determines 
orthographic similarity (Humphreys et al., 1987)).

After the dynamic programming stage, multidime,sional scaling (Torgerson, 1958) 
is used to convert the inter-word similarity lnatrix into a vector space representation 
in which distance correlates with similarity 
Next, word vectors are normalized by projecting them onto a semi-hypersphere. 
This gives the origin of the vector space a meaning, allowing us to use vector 
magnitude to represent signal energy. 
This representation also yielded natural choices for the blank stimulus and the 
mask stimulus. The blank was taken to be the origin of the space and the 
mask was taken to be a vector on the far side of the hypersphere. In the dynamical 
model that we describe below, vectors that are far apart have maximally disruptive 
effects on each other. A distant stimulus causes the state to move rapidly away 
from a particular word vector, thus interfering maximally with its processing. 
4 PROCESSING 
4.1 
FORMALIZATION OF THE PROBLEM AS A SIGNAL 
DETECTION PROBLEM 
We formalize the problem of visual word recognition as a problem of detecting 
significant fluctuations of a multidimensional signal embedded in noise. This can 
be viewed as a maximum likelihood detection problem in which the onsets and 
durations of the signal are not known a priori. Our model has two main levels of 
processing: a perceptual stage and a detection stage. 
Perceptual Stage 
The perceptual stage is a bank of noisy linear filters. Let l/Vi denote the n- 
dimensional word vector presented at time t, with components l/Vi,k. The word 
vector is corrupted with white noise e[t] to form the input uk[t]: 
u[t] = wi, + 
and this input is filtered: 
rk[t] - -,ork[t - 1]- ,xr.[t - 2] + buk[t] + r/It], 
in the presence of additional white noise r/[t]. 
Detection Stages 
The first detection stage in the model is a linear filter whose inverted impulse 
response is matched to the impulse response of the perceptual filter: 
sk[t] = -cosk[t - 1]- cxsk[t - 2] + drk[t]. 
Such a filter is known as a matched filler, and is known to have optimality properties 
that make it an effective preprocessor for a system that utilizes thresholds for making 
decisions (van Trees, 1968). The output of the matched filter is projected onto each 
of the words in the lexicon to form scalar word activation signals xi[t] that can 
be compared to thresholds:

signals in the model projected onto the vector for the word bring. Bring was pre- 
sented for 100 ms, followed by a 300 ms blank, followed by a second presentation 
of bring for 300 ms. 
The decision process is a simple binary decision based on a variable baseline Iti[t] 
and a variable threshold Oi[t]: 
1 if xi[t]- Iti[t] > Oi[t] 
yi = 0 otherwise 
4.2 DETECTION DYNAMICS 
The problem of detecting signals that may overlap in time and have unknown onsets 
and unknown durations requires the system to focus on fluctuations rather than the 
absolute heights of the activation curves. Moreover, the test for significance of a 
fluctuation must be dependent on the state of the detection mechanism and the 
state of the filters. Our significance test utilizes two time-varying quantities to 
capture this state-dependence: the baseline it and the threshold 0. 
The baseline iti [t] varies as follows. On time steps for which the fluctuations are 
subthreshold (yi[t] = 0, for all i), each baseline simply tracks the most recent

minimum value of the corresponding word activation signal: 
it/[/- 1] if xi[I] > iti[t] 
iti[t]: xg[t] otherwise 
When a fluctuation passes threshold (yi[t] = 1, for some i), the word i is detected, 
and the baselines of all words are increased: 
itk[t]: itk[t - 1] + (i,k), 
where b(i, k) is the angle between Wi and W and  is a positive scaling parameter. 
This rule prevents multiple detections during a single presentation and it prevents 
the neighbors of a detected word from being detected due to their overlap with the 
detected word. 
The threshold Oi is subject to first-order dynamics that serve to increase or de- 
crease the threshold as a function of the recent activation history of the word (a 
rudimentary form of adaptation): 
Oi[t] = cOi[t -- 1] + (1 - c)O/� -/3(xi[t]- it/[/])+, 
where c and / are positive numbers. This rule has the effect of decreasing the 
threshold if the activation of the word is currently above its baseline, and increasing 
the threshold toward its nominal value O/� otherwise. 
4.3 PARAMETERS 
The parameters in the model were determined from the behavioral data and from 
the structural assumptions of the model in the following manner. The dynamics of 
the perceptual filter were determined by the time constants of masked priming, as 
given by the behavioral
