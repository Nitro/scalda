Abstract 
A new decomposition algorithm for training regression Support 
Vector Machines (SVM) is presented. The algorithm builds on 
the basic principles of decomposition proposed by Osuna et. al., 
and addresses the issue of optimal working set selection. The new 
criteria for testing optimality of a working set are derived. Based 
on these criteria, the principle of maximal inconsistency is pro- 
posed to form (approximately) optimal working sets. Experimental 
results show superior performance of the new algorithm in compar- 
ison with traditional training of regression SVM without decompo- 
sition. Similar results have been previously reported on decomposi- 
tion algorithms for pattern recognition SVM. The new algorithm is 
also applicable to advanced SVM formulations based on regression, 
such as density estimation and integral equation SVM. 
I Introduction 
The increasing interest in applications of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to large- 
scale problems ushers in new requirements for computational complexity of their 
training algorithms. Requests have been recently made for algorithms capable of 
handling problems containing 10 5 - 10 6 examples [1]. Training an SVM constitutes 
a quadratic programming problem, and a typical SVM package uses an off-the-shelf 
optimization software to obtain a solution to it. The number of variables in the 
optimization problem is equal to the number of training data points (for the pattern 
recognition SVM) or twice that number (for the regression SVM). The speed of 
general-purpose optimization methods is insufficient for problems containling more 
than a few thousand examples. This has motivated a quest for special-purpose 
training algorithms to take advantage of the particular structure of SVM training 
problems. 
The main avenue of research in SVM training algorithms is decomposition. The key 
idea of decomposition, due to Osuna et. al. [2], is to freeze all but a small number of 
optimization variables, and to solve a sequence of small fixed-size problems. The set 
of variables whose values are optimized at a current iteration is called the working 
set. Complexity of re-optimizing the working set is assumed to be constant-time.

In order for a decomposition algorithm to be successful, the working set must be 
selected in a smart way. The fastest known decomposition algorithm is due to 
Joachims [3]. It is based on Zoutendijk's method of feasible directions proposed in 
the optimization community in the early 1960's. However Joachims' algorithm is 
limited to pattern recognition SVM because it makes use of labels being 4-1. The 
current article presents a similar algorithm for the regression SVM. 
The new algorithm utilizes a slightly different background from optimization the- 
ory. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Theorem is used to derive conditions for determining 
whether or not a given working set is optimal. These conditions become the algo- 
rithm's termination criteria, as an alternative to Osuna's criteria (also used by 
Joachims without modification) which used conditions for individual points. The 
advantage of the new conditions is that knowledge of the hyperplane's constant 
factor b, which in some cases is difficult to compute, is not required. Further inves- 
tigation of the new termination conditions allows to form the strategy for selecting 
an optimal working set. The new algorithm is applicable to the pattern recognition 
SVM, and is provably equivalent to Joachims' algorithm. One can also interpret 
the new algorithm in the sense of the method of feasible directions. Experimental 
results presented in the last section demonstrate superior performance of the new 
method in comparison with traditional training of regression SVM. 
2 General Principles of Regression SVM Decomposition 
The original decomposition algorithm proposed for the pattern recognition SVM in 
[2] has been extended to the regression SVM in [4]. For the sake of completeness 
I will repeat the main steps of this extension with the aim of providing terse and 
streamlined notation to lay the ground for working set selection. 
Given the training data of size l, training of the regression SVM amounts to solving 
the following quadratic programming problem in 21 variables: 
Maximize W(&) = T&_ I&TD& 
subject to: c T& = 0 (1) 
&-C1 < 0 
& > 0 
where 
c ' = -y el ' D= -K K ' c= -1 
The basic idea of decomposition is to split the variable vector  into the working set 
B of fixed size q and the non-working set N containing the rest of the variables. 
The corresponding parts of vectors c and r will also bear subscripts N and B. The 
matrix D is partitioned into DBB, DBN = DB and DvN. A further requirement 
is that, for the i-th element of the training data, both ci and c i are either included 
in or omitted from the working set. 1 The values of the variables in the non-working 
set are frozen for the iteration, and optimization is only performed with respect to 
the variables in the working set. 
Optimization of the working set is also a quadratic program. This can be seen 
by re-arranging the terms of the objective function and the equality constraint in

quadratic program (sub-problem) is formulated as follows: 
The resulting 
I T 
Maximize WB(&B) : ( -- &vDNB)&B -- &BDBB&B 
subject to: c&B +c&N = 0 (2) 
&s - C1 < 0 
&  0 
The basic decomposition algorithm chooses the first working set at random, and 
proceeds iteratively by selecting sub-optimal working sets and re-optimizing them, 
by solving quadratic program (2), until all subsets of size q are optimal. The precise 
formulation of termination conditions will be developed in the following section. 
3 Optimality of a Working Set 
In order to maintain strict improvement of the objective function, the working 
set must be sub-optimal before re-optimization. The classical Karush-Kuhn-Tucker 
(KKT) conditions are necessary and sufficient for optimality of a quadratic program. 
I will use these conditions applied to the standard form of a quadratic program, as 
described in [5], p. 36. 
The standard form of a quadratic program requires that all constraints are of equal- 
ity type except for non-negativity constraints. To cast the reression SVM quadratic 
program (1) into the standard form, the slack variables s ' - (s,... ,s2t) corre- 
sponding to the box constraints, and the following matrices are introduced: 
I = z= f= 
E= 0 ' ' ' 
(s) 
where I is a vector of length l, C is a vector of length 21. The zero element in vector 
z reflects the fact that a slack variable for the equality constraint must be zero. In 
the matrix notation all constraints of problem (1) can be compactly expressed as: 
Tz : f 
z > 0 (4) 
In this notation the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Theorem can be stated as follows: 
Theorem 1 (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Theorem) The primal vector z solves the 
quadratic problem (1) if and only if it satisfies () and there exists a dual vector 
ur= (Ii r w r) = (Ii r (p �r)) sch that: 
II = D&+Ew- _> 0 (5) 
T _> 0 (6) 
urz = 0 (7) 
It follows from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Theorem that if for all u satisfying con- 
ditions (6) - (7) the system of inequalities (5) is inconsistent then the solution of 
problem (1) is not optimal. Since the objective function of sub-problem (2) was 
obtained by merely re-arranging terms in the objective function of the initial prob- 
lem (1), the same conditions guarantee that the sub-problem (2) is not optimal. 
Thus, the main strategy for identifying sub-optimal working sets will be to enforce 
inconsistency of the system (5) while satisfying conditions (6) - (7).

Let us further analyze inequalities in (5). Each inequality has one of the following 
forms: 
where 
 = -c+e+v+t _Y 0 (8) 
7r = ci + e - vi - la _ 0 (9) 
l 
cfii = Yi - E(ctj -ctj)Kij 
j=l 
Consider the values cti can possible take: 
ctl = 0. In this case si = C, and, by complementarity condition (7), vi = O. 
Then inequality (8) becomes: 
r  = - c  + e + t _ 0 = ta _ c i - e 
2. cti = C. By complementarity condition (7), ri = 0. Then inequality (8) 
becomes: 
-c)i + e + tz + v = 0  tz _< c)i - e 
3. 0 < cti < C. By complementarity condition (7), vi = 0, *ri = 0. 
inequality (8) becomes: 
Then 
Similar reasoning for ct**. and inequality (9) yields the following results: 
1. ct i = 0. Then 
2. ct i = C. Then 
3. 0<ct i <C. Then 
tz = c)i +e 
As one can see, the only free variable in system (5) is/. Each inequality restricts 
/ to a certain interval on a real line. Such intervals will be denoted as la-sets in 
the rest of the exposition. Any subset of inequalities in (5) is inconsistent if the 
intersection of the corresponding/-sets is empty. This provides a lucid rule for 
determining optimality of any working set: it is sub-optimal if the intersection of 
/-sets of all its points is empty. A sub-optimal working set will also be denoted as 
inconsistent. The following summarizes the rules for calculation of/-sets, taking 
into account that for regression SVM cic i = 0: 
.A/li -- 
[i -- , i q- ],

4 Maximal Inconsistency Algorithm 
While inconsistency of the working set at each iteration guarantees convergence of 
decomposition, the rate of convergence is quite slow if arbitrary inconsistent working 
sets are chosen. A natural heuristic is to select maximally in
