ABSTRACT 
The forward modeling approach is a methodology for learning con- 
trol when data is available in distal coordinate systems. We extend 
previous work by considering how this methodology can be applied 
to the optimization of quantities that are distal not only in space 
but also in time. 
In many learning control problems, the output variables of the controller are not 
the natural coordinates in which to specify tasks and evaluate performance. Tasks 
are generally more naturally specified in distal coordinate systems (e.g., endpoint 
coordinates for manipulator motion) than in the proximal coordinate system of 
the controller (e.g., joint angles or torques). Furthermore, the relationship between 
proximal coordinates and distal coordinates is often not known a priori and, if 
known, not easily inverted. 
The forward modeling approach is a methodology for learning control when train- 
ing data is available in distal coordinate systems. A forward model is a network 
that learns the transformation from proximal to distal coordinates so that distal 
specifications can be used in training the controller (Jordan & Rumelhart, 1990). 
The forward model can often be learned separately from the controller because it 
depends only on the dynamics of the controlled system and not on the closed-loop 
dynamics. 
In previous work, we studied forward models of kinematic transformations (Jordan, 
1988, 1990) and state transitions (Jordan & Rumelhart, 1990). In the current paper, 
Learning to Control an Unstable System with Forward Modeling 325 
we go beyond the spatial credit assignment problems studied in those papers and 
broaden the application of forward modeling to include cases of temporal credit 
assignment (cf. Barto, Sutton,  Anderson, 1983; Werbos, 1987). As discussed 
below, the function to be modeled in such cases depends on a time integral of the 
closed-loop dynamics. This fact has two important implications. First, the data 
needed for learning the forward model can no longer be obtained solely by observing 
the instantaneous state or output of the plant. Second, the forward model is no 
longer independent of the controller: If the parameters of the controller are changed 
by a learning algorithm, then the closed-loop dynamics change and so does the 
mapping from proximal to distal variables. Thus the learning of the forward model 
and the learning of the controller can no longer be separated into different phases. 
1 FORWARD MODELING 
In this section we briefly summarize our previous work on forward modeling (see 
also Nguyen  Widrow, 1989 and Werbos, 1987). 
1.1 LEARNING A FORWARD MODEL 
Given a fixed control law, the learning of a forward model is a system identification 
problem. Let z - g(s, u) be a system to be modeled, where z is the output or the 
state-derivative, s is the state, and u is the control. We require the forward model 
to minimize the cost functional 
(1) 
where i - O(s, u,v) is the parameterized function computed by the model. Once 
the minimum is found, backpropagation through the model provides an estimate 
0z (cf. Jordan, 1988).

1.2 LEARNING A CONTROLLER 
Once the forward model is sufficiently accurate, it can be used in the training of the 
controller. Backpropagation through the model provides derivatives that indicate 
how to change the outputs of the controller. These derivatives can be used to 
change the parameters of the controller by a further application of backpropagation. 
Figure i illustrates the general procedure. 
This procedure minimizes the distal cost functional 
(2) 
where z* is a reference signal. To see this, let the controller output be given as a 
function u - f(s, z*, w) of the state s*, the reference signal z*, and a parameter 
vector w. Differentiating J with respect to w yields

We now consider a task in which the foregoing framework must be broadened to 
allow a more general form of distal task specification. 
2 THE TASK 
The task is to learn to regulate an unstable nonminimum-phase plant. We have 
chosen the oft-studied (e.g., Barto, Sutton, & Anderson, 1983; Widrow & Smith, 
1964) problem of learning to balance an inverted pendulum on a moving cart. The 
plant dynamics are given by: 
mlcosO I b' + --mgisinO = 0 
where rn is the mass of the pole, M is the mass of the cart, i is half the pole length, 
I is the inertia of the pole around its base, and F is the force applied to the cart. 
The task we studied is similar to that studied by Barto, Sutton,  Anderson (1983). 
A state-feedback controller provides forces to the cart, and the system evolves until 
failure occurs (the cart reaches the end of the track or the pole reaches a critical 
angle). The system learns from failure; indeed, it is assumed that the only teaching 
information provided by the environment is the signal that failure has occurred.

Figure 2: The Network Architecture 
There are several differences between our task and that studied by Barto, Sutton,/ 
Anderson (1983). First, disturbances (white noise) are provided by the environment 
rather than by the learning algorithm. This implies that in our experiments the 
level of noise seen by the controller does not diminish to zero over the course of 
learning. Second, we used real-valued forces rather than binary forces. Finally, we 
do not assume the existence of a reset button that reinitializes the system to the 
origin of state space; upon failure the system is restatted in a random configuration. 
3 OUR APPROACH 
In our approach, the control system learns a model that relates the current state of 
the plant and the current control signal to a prediction of future failure. We make 
use of a temporal difference algorithm (Sutton, 1988) to learn the transformation 
from (state, action) pairs to an estimate of the inverse of the time until failure. 
This mapping is then used as a differentiable forward model in the learning of the 
controller--the controller is changed so as to minimize the output of the model and 
thereby maximize the time until failure. 
The overall system architecture is shown in Figure 2. We describe each component 
in detail in the following sections. 
An important feature that distinguishes this architecture from previous work (e.g., 
328 Jordan and Jacobs 
Barto, Sutton, & Anderson, 1983) is the path from the action unit into the forward 
model. This path is necessary for supervised learning algorithms to be used (see 
also Werbos, 1987). 
3.1 LEARNING THE FORWARD MODEL 
Temporal difference algorithms learn to make long term predictions by achieving 
local consistency between predictions at neighboring time steps, and by grounding 
the chain of predictions when information from the environment is obtained. In our 
case, if z(t) is the inverse of the time until failure, then consistency is defined by 
the requirement that z-(t) - z-(t + 1) + 1. The chain is grounded by defining 
z(T) - 1, where T is the time step on which failure occurs. 
To learn to estimate the inverse of the time until failure, the following temporal 
difference error terms are used. For time steps on which failure does not occur, 
1 
e(t) = 1 + :-:(t + 1) - 
where 2(t) denotes the output of the forward model. When failure occurs, the target 
for the forward model is set to unity: 
e(t) = 1- 
The error signal e(t) is propagated backwards at time t + 1 using activations saved 
from time t. Standard backpropagation is used to compute the changes to the 
weights. 
3.2 LEARNING THE CONTROLLER 
If the controller is performing as desired, then the output of the forward model 
is zero (that is, the predicted time-until-failure is infinity). This suggests that an 
appropriate distal error signal for the controller is zero minus the output of the 
forward model. 
Given that the forward model has the control action as an input, the distal error 
can be propagated backward to the hidden units of the forward model, through the 
action unit, and into the controller where the weights are changed (see Figure 2). 
Thus the controller is changed in such a way as to minimize the output of the 
forward model and thereby maximize the time until failure. 
3.3 LEARNING THE FORWARD MODEL AND THE CONTROLLER 
SIMULTANEOUSLY 
As the controller varies, the mapping that the forward model must learn also varies. 
Thus, if the forward model is to provide reasonable derivatives, it must be contin- 
uously updated as the controller changes. We find that it is possible to train the 
forward model and the controller simultaneously, provided that we use a larger 
learning rate for the forward model than for the controller.

4.1 RESET 
Although previous studies have assumed the existence of a reset button that 
can restart the system at the origin of state space, we prefer not to make such an 
assumption. A reset button implies the existence of a controller that can stabilize 
the system, and the
