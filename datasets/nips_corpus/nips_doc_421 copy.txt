Abstract 
The Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982,1984) provides a simple model of an 
associative memory in a neuronal structure. This model, however, is based 
on highly artificial assumptions, especially the use of formal-two state neu- 
rons (Hopfield, 1982) or graded-response neurons (Hopfield, 1984). What 
happens if we replace the formal neurons by 'real' biological neurons? We 
address this question in two steps. First, we show that a simple model of 
a neuron can capture all relevant features of neuron spiking, i.e., a wide 
range of spiking frequencies and a realistic distribution of interspike inter- 
vals. Second, we construct an associative memory by linking these neurons 
together. The analytical solution for a large and fully connected network 
shows that the Hopfield solution is valid only for neurons with a short re- 
fractory period. If the refractory period is longer than a critical duration 
7c, the solutions are qualitatively different. The associative character of 
the solutions, however, is preserved. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Information received at the sensory level is encoded in spike trains which are then 
transmitted to different parts of the brain where the main processing steps occur. 
Since all the spikes of any particular neuron look alike, the information of the spike 
train is obviously not contained in the exact shape of the spikes, but rather in 
their arrival times and in the correlations between the spikes. A model neuron 
which tries to keep track of the voltage trace even during the spiking--like the

Hodgkin Huxley equations (Hodgkin, 1952) and similar models--carries therefore 
non-essential details, if we are only interested in the information of the spike train. 
On the other hand, a simple two-state neuron or threshold model is too simplistic 
since it cannot reproduce the variety of spiking behaviour found in real neurons. The 
same is true for continuous or analog model neurons which disregard the stochastic 
nature of neuron firing completely. In this work we construct a model of the neuron 
which is intermediate between these extremes. We are not concerned with the shape 
of the spikes and detailed voltage traces, but we want realistic interval distributions 
and rate functions. Finally, we link these neurons together to capture collective 
effects and we construct a network that can function as an associative memory. 
2 THE MODEL NEURON 
From a neural-network point of view it is often convenient to consider a neuron 
as a simple computational unit with no internal parameters. In this case, the 
neuron is described either as a 'digital' theshold unit or as a nonlinear 'analog' 
element with a sigmoid input-output relation. While such a simple model might be 
useful for formal considerations in abstract networks, it is hard to see how it could 
be modified to include realistic features of neurons: How can we account for the 
statistical properties of the spike train beyond the mean firing frequencies? What 
about bursting or oscillating neurons? - to mention but a few of the problems with 
real neurons. 
We would like to use a model neuron which is closer to biology in the sense that it 
produces spike trains comparable of those in real neurons. Our description of the 
spiking dynamics therefore emphasizes three basic notions of neurobiology: thresh- 
old, refractory period, and noise. In particular we describe the internal state of the 
neuron by the membrane voltage h which depends on the synaptic contributions 
from other neurons as well as on the spiking history of the neuron itself. In a simple 
threshold crossing process, a spike would be initiated as soon as the voltage 
crosses the threshold O. Due to the statistical fluctuations of the momentary voltage 
around h(/), however, the spiking will be a statistical event, the spikes coming a 
bit too early or a bit too late compared to the formal threshold crossing time, de- 
pending on the direction of the fluctuations. This fact will be taken into account by 
introducing a probabilistic spiking rate r, which depends on the difference between 
the membrane voltage h and the threshold  in an exponential fashion: 
1 
r = -- exp[/?(h -0)], (1) 
'0 
where the formal temperature/- is a measure for the noise and '0 is an internal 
time constant of the neuron. If h changes only slowly during a conveniently cho- 
sen time 'l, we can integrate over v, which yields the probability Pt(h) of firing 
during a time step of length v. This gives us an analytic procedure to switch from 
continuous time to the discrete time step representation used later on. 
If a spike is initiated in a real neuron, the neuron goes through a cycle of ion influx 
and effiux which changes the potential on a fast time scale and prevents immediate 
firing of another spike. To model this we reset the potential after each spike by 
86 Gers[ner 
adding a negative refractory field h(t) to the potential: 
with 
= (3) 
i 
where ti is the time of the i th spike and h(l) is the postsynaptic potential due 
to incoming spikes from other neurons. The form of the refractory function e'(r) 
together with the noise level  determine the firing characteristics of the neuron. 
With fairly simple refractory fields we can achieve a sigmoid dependence of the 
firing frequency upon the input current (figure 1) and realistic spiking statistics 
(figure 3).

or to model neurons with adaptive behavior. 
In figure 4 we show a bursting neuron defined by a long-tailed refractory function 
with a slight overshooting at intermediate time delays. At low input level, the bursts 
are noise induced and appear in irregular intervals. For larger driving currents the 
spiking changes to regular bursting. Even a model with a simple absolute refractory

3 THE NETWORK 
So far we have only described the dynamics which initiates the spikes in the neurons. 
Now we have to describe the spikes themselves and their synaptic transmission to 
other neurons. To keep track of the spikes we assign to each neuron a two state 
variable Si which usually rests at -1 and flips to +1 only when a spike is initiated. 
In the discrete time step representation that we assume in the following the output 
of each neuron is then described by a sequence of Ising spins Si(t.).

In a network of neurons, neuron i may recieve a spike from neuron j via the synaptic 
connection, and the spike will evoke a postsynaptic potential at i. The strength of 
this response will depend on the synaptic efficacy Jij. The time course of this 
response, however, can be taken to have a generic form independent of the strength 
of the synapse. We forrealize these ideas assuming linearity and write 
j 
where �(r) might be an experimental response function and j is a conveniently 
normalized variable proportional to

where the varables ' = +1,(1 _< i _< N, 1 _< p _< r) describe the p random 
patterns to be stored. We can obtain these synaptic weights by a Itebbian learning 
procedure. It is now straightforward to incorporate the internal dynamics of the 
neurons, which we described in the preceding section. The refractory field can be 
introduced as the diagonal elements of the synaptic connection matrix 
h[(t.) =  J,,(r.)[i(t,, - r.) + 1]. (7) 
If all the neurons are equivalent, the diagonal elements must be independent of i 
and Jii(r) = er(r) describes the generic voltage response of our model neuron after 
firing of a spike. 
4 RESULTS 
We can solve this model analytically in the limit of a large and fully connected 
network. The solution depends on an additional parameter p which characterizes 
the maximum spiking frequency of the neurons. To compare our results with the
