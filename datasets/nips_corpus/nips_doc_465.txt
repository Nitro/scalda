Abstract 
A CCD based signal processing IC that computes a fully parallel single 
quadrant vector-matrix multiplication has been designed and fabricated with a 
2}.tm CCD/CMOS process. The device incorporates an array of Charge 
Coupled Devices (CCD) which hold an analog matrix of charge encoding the 
matrix elements. Input vectors are digital with 1 - 8 bit accuracy. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) is often used in neural network theories to describe 
the aggregation of signals by neurons. An input vector encoding the activation levels of 
input neurons is multiplied by a matrix encoding the synaptic connection strengths to 
create an output vector. The analog VLSI architecture presented here has been devised to 
perform the vector-matrix multiplication using CCD technology. The architecture 
calculates a VMM in one clock cycle, an improvement over previous semiparallel devices 
(Agranat et al., 1988), (Chiang, 1990). This architecture is also useful for general signal 
processing applications where moderate resolution is required, such as image processing. 
As most neural models have robust behavior in the presence of noise and inaccuracies, 
analog VLSI offers the potential for highly compact neural circuitry. Analog 
multiplication circuitry can be made much smaller than its digital equivalent, offering 
substantial savings in power and IC size at the expense of limited accuracy and 
programmability. Digital I/O, however, is desirable as it allows the use of standard 
memory and control circuits at the system level. The device presented here has digital 
input and analog output and elucidates all relevant performance characteristics including

accuracy, speed, power dissipation and charge retention of the VMM. In practice, on-chip 
charge domain A/D converters are used for converting analog output signals to facilitate 
digital communication with off-chip devices.

2 ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION 
The vector-matrix multiplier consists of a matrix of CCD cells that resemble Charge 
Injection Device (CID) imager pixels in that one of the cell's gates is connected vertically 
from cell to cell forming a column electrode while another gate is connected horizontally 
forming a row electrode. The charge stored beneath the row and column gates encodes 
the matrix. A simplified schematic in Figure 1 shows the array organization. 
2.1 BINARY VECTOR MATRIX MULTIPLICATION 
In its most basic configuration, the VMM circuit computes the product of a binary input 
vector, Uj, and an analog matrix of charge. The computation done by each CID cell in 
the matrix is a multiply-accumulate in which the charge, Qij, is multiplied by a binary 
input vector element, Uj, encoded on the column line and this product is summed with 
other products in the same row to form the vector product, I i, on the row lines. 
Multiplication by a binary number is equivalent to adding or not adding the charge at a 
750 Neugebauer and Yariv 
particular matrix element to its associated row line. 
The matrix element operation is shown in Figure 2 which displays a cross-section of one 
of the rows with the associated potential wells at different times in the computation.

Figure 2: CID Cell Operation 
In the initial state, prior to the VMM computation, the matrix of charges Qij is moved 
A Parallel Analog CCD/CMOS Signal Processor 751 
beneath the column electrodes by placing a positive voltage on all column lines, shown 
in Figure 2(a). A positive voltage creates a deep potential well for electrons. At this 
point, the row lines are reset to a reference voltage, Vro w, by FrETs Q1 and then 
disconnected from the voltage source, shown in Figure 2(b). The computation occurs 
when the column lines are pulsed to a negative voltage corresponding to the input vector 
Uj, shown in Figure 2(c). The binary Uj is represented by a negative pulse on the jth 
column line if the element Uj is a binary 1, otherwise the column line is kept at the 
positive voltage. This causes the charges in the columns that correspond to binary l's in 
the input vector to be transferred to their respective row electrodes which thus experience a 
voltage change given by 
N-1 
AVi =  QijUj 
j=0 Crow 
where N is the number of elements in the input vector and Cro w is the total capacitance 
of the row electrode. Once the charge has been transferred, the column lines are reset to 
their original positive voltages 1, resulting in the potential diagram in Figure 2(d). The 
voltage changes on the row lines are then sampled and the matrix of charges are returned 
to the column electrodes in preparation for the next VMM by pulsing the row electrodes 
negative as in Figure 2(e). In this manner, a complete binary vector is multiplied by an 
analog matrix of charge in one CCD clock cycle. 
3 DESIGN AND OPERATION 
The implementation of this architecture contains facilities for electronic loading of the 
matrix. Originally proposed as an optically loaded device (Agranat et al., 1988), the 
electronically loaded version has proven more reliable and consistent. 
3.1 LOADING THE CCD ARRAY WITH MATRIX ELEMENTS 
The CCD matrix elements described above can be modified to operate as standard four 
phase CCD shift registers by simply adding another gate. The matrix cell is shown in 
Figure 3. The fabricated single quadrant cell size is 24gm by 24gin using a 2gin 
minimum feature size CCD/CMOS process. More aggressive design rules in the same 
process can reduce this to 20gin by 201xm. These cells, when abutted with each other in 
a row, form a horizontal shift register which is used to load the matrix. Electronic 
loading of the matrix is accomplished in a fashion similar to CCD imagers. A fast CCD 
shift register running vertically is added along one side of the matfix which is loaded with 
one column of matrix charges from a single external analog data source. Once the fast 
shift register is loaded, it is transferred into the array by clocking the matrix electrodes to 
act as an array of horizontal shift registers, shown in Figure 3(a). This process is repeated 
until the entire matrix has been filled with charge. 
1 Returning the column lines to their original voltage levels has the effect of canceling the 
effect of stray capacitive coupling between the row and column lines, since the net column 
voltage change is zero.

Figure 3: CID Cell Used to Load Matrix 
When the matrix has been loaded, the charge can be used for computation with two of the 
four gates at each matrix cell kept at constant potentials, shown in Figure 30>). The 
computation process moves the charge repeatedly between two electrodes. Incomplete 
charge transfer, a problem with our previous architecture (Agranat et al., 1990), does not 
degrade performance since any charge left behind under the column gates during 
computation is picked up on the next cycle, shown in Figure 2(e). Only dark current 
generation degrades the matrix charges during VMM, causing them to increase 
nonuniformly. In order to limit the effects of dark current generation on the matrix 
precision, the matrix charge must be refreshed periodically. 
3.2 FLOATING GATE ROW AMPLIFIERS 
In order to achieve better lineaxity when sensing charge, a floating gate amplifier is often 
used in CCD circuits. In the scheme described above, the induced voltage change of the 
row electrode significantly modifies its parasitic capacitance, resulting in a nonlinear 
voltage versus charge characteristic. To alleviate this problem, an operational amplifier 
with a capacitor in the feedback loop is added to each row line, shown in Figure 4. When 
A Parallel Analog CCD/CMOS Signal Processor 753 
charge is moved underneath the row line in the course of a VMM operation, the row 
voltage is kept constant by the action of the op-amp with an output voltage given by 
N-1 
AVi =  QijUj

where Cf is the feedback capacitance.

The feedback capacitor is a poly-poly structure with vastly improved linearity compared to 
the row capacitance. This enhancement also has the effect of speeding the row line 
summation due to the well known benefits of current mode transmission. In addition, 
the possibility of digitally selecting a feedback capacitor value by switching power-of-two 
sized capacitors into the feedback loops creates a practical means of controlling the gain of 
the output amplifiers, with the potential for significantly extending the dynamic range of 
the device. 
3.3 DIGITAL INPUT BUFFER AND DIVIDE-BY-TWO CIRCUITRY 
Many applications such as image processing require multilevel input capability. This can 
easily be implemented by using the VMM circuitry in a bit-serial mode. The operation 
of the device is identical to the structure described above except that processing n-bit input 
precision requires n cycles of the device. Digital shift registers are added to each input 
column line that sequentially present the column lines with successively more significant 
bits of the input vector, shown in Figure 5. Using the notation uj(n-1), which represents 
the binary vector formed by taking the nth bits of all the input elements, the first VMM 
done by the circuit is given by
