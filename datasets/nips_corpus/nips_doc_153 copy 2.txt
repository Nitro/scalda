ABSTRACT 
This paper presents a variation of the back-propagation algo- 
rithm that makes optimal use of a network hidden units by de- 
creasing an nergy term written as a function of the squared 
activations of these hidden units. The algorithm can automati- 
cally find optimal or nearly optimal architectures necessary to 
solve known Boolean functions, facfiitate the interpretation of 
the activation of the remaining hidden units and automatically 
estimate the complexity of architectures appropriate for phonetic 
labeling problems. The general principle of the algorithm can 
also be adapted to different tasks: for example, it can be used to 
eliminate the [0, 0] local minimum of the [-1, +1] logistic acti- 
vation function while preserving a much faster convergence and 
forcing binary activations over the set of hidden units. 
PRINCIPLE 
This paper describes an algorithm which makes optimal use of the hidden units in 
a network using the standard back-propagation algorithm (Rumelhart, Hinton & 
Williams, 1986). Optimality is defined as the minimization of a function of the 
energy spent by the hidden units throughtout the network, independently of 
the chosen architecture, and where the energy is written as a function of the 
squared activations of the hidden units. 
The standard back-propagation algorithm is a gradient descent algorithm on the 
following cost function: 
P O 
c -- 
j i 
where d is the desired output of an output unit, o the actual output, and where 
the sum is taken over the set of output units 0 for the set of training patterns P.

The following algorithm implements a gradient descent on the following cost func- 
tion: 
P 0 P H 
C= !er Z Z (dij-oij) 2 + !en Z Z e(oj) [21 
j i j i 
where e is a positive monotonic function and where the sum of the second term is 
now taken over a set or subset of the hidden units H. The first term of this cost 
function will be called the error term, the second, the energy term. 
In principle, the theoretical minimum of this function is found when the desired 
activations are equal to the actual activations for all output units and all presented 
patterns and when the hidden units do not spend any energy. In practical 
cases, such a minimum cannot be reached and the hidden units have to spend 
some energy to solve a given problem. The quantity of energy will be in part 
determined by the relative importance given to the error and energy terms during 
gradient descent. In principle, if a hidden unit has a constant activation whatever 
the pattern presented to the network, it contributes to the energy term only and 
will be suppressed by the algorithm. The precise energy distribution among the 
hidden units will depend on the actual energy function e.

ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION 
We can write the total cost function that the algorithm tries to minimize as a 
weighted sum of an error and energy term: 
C = laerEer + laenEen 
[3] 
The first term is the error term used with the standard back-propagation algo- 
rithm in Rumelhart et al. If we have h hidden layers, we can write the total 
energy term as a sum of all the energy terms corresponding to each hidden layer: 
h H 
[4] 
To decrease the energy of the uppermost hidden layer Hh, we can compute the 
derivative of the energy function with respect to the weights. This derivative will 
be null for any weight above the considered hidden layer. For any weight just 
below the considered hidden layer, we have (using Rumelhart et al. notation):

where the derivative of e is taken with respect to the energy of the unit i and 
where f corresponds to the logistic function. For any hidden layer below the 
considered layer h, the chain rule yields: 
J 
This is just. standard back-propagation with a different back-propagated term. If 
we minimize both the error at the output layer and the energy of the hidden layer 
h, we can compute the complete weight change for any connection below layer h: 
= - t en = - tOlOtert[ r +/ttent[ n) = - tOlt c 
Awtl a/tter rO1 - al ten t O1 
[8] 
where 6c is now the delta accumulated for error and energy that we can write as 
a function of the deltas of the upper layer: 
t}Ic = f'l(nett) Z Oterr + lten{}[n)wil = f'l(rleti) Z }?wit 
i i 
This means that instead of propagating the delta for both energy and error, we 
can compute an accumulated delta for hidden layer h and propagate it back 
throughout the network. If we minimize the energy of the layers h and h-I, the 
new accumulated delta will equal the previously accumulated delta added to a 
new delta energy on layer h-1. The procedure can be repeated throughout the 
complete network. In short, the back-propagated error signal used to change the 
weights of each layer is simply equal to the back-propagated signal used in the 
previous layer augmented with the delta energy of the current hidden layer. (The 
algorithm is local and easy to implement). 
ENERGY FUNCTION 
The algorithm is sensitive to the energy function e being minimized. The func- 
tions used in the simulations described below have the following derivative with 
522 Chauvin 
respect to the squared activations/energy (only this derivative is necessary to im- 
plement the algorithm, see Equation [6]): 
e' Oe(�Z) 
= = . [10] 
where n is an integer that determines the precise shape of the energy function 
(see Table 1) and modulates the behavior of the algorithm in the following way. 
For n = O, e is a linear function of the energy: high and low energy units are 
equally penalized. For n = 1, e is a logarithmic function and low energy units 
become more penalized than high energy units, in proportion to the linear 
case. For n = 2, the energy penalty may reach an asymptote as the energy in- 
creases: high energy units are not penalized more than middle energy units. 
In the simulations, as expected, it appears that higher values of n tend to suppress 
low energy units. (For n > 2, the behavior of the algorithm was not signifi- 
cantly different from n = 2, for the tests described below).

BOOLEAN EXAMPLES 
The algorithm was tested with a set of Boolean problems. In typical tasks, the 
energy of the network significantly decreases during early learning. Later on, the 
network finds a better minimum of the total cost function by decreasing the error 
and by spending energy to solve the problem. Figure 1 shows energy and error 
in function of the number of learning cycles during a typical task (XOR) for 4 
different runs. For a broad range of the energy learning rate, the algorithm is 
quite stable and finds the solution to the given problem. This nice behavior is 
also quite independent of the variations of the onset of energy minimization. 
EXCLUSIVE OR AND PARITY 
The algorithm was tested with EXOR for various network archkectures. Figure 2 
shows an example of the activation of the hidden units after learning. The algo- 
rithm finds a minimal solution (2 hidden units, minimum logic) to solve the 
XOR problem when the energy is being minimized. This minimal solution is 
actually found whatever the starting number of hidden units. If several layers are 
used, the algorithm finds an optimal or nearly-optimal size for each layer.

presentations for different values of the energy rate (0, .1, .2, .4). Each 
energy curve (e label) is associated with an error curve (+ label). 
During learning, the units spend some energy to solve the given task. 
With parity 3, for a [-1, +1] activation range of the sigmoid function, the algo- 
rithm does not find the 2 hidden units optimal solution but has no problem find- 
ing a 3 hidden units solution, independently of the starting architecture. 
SYMMETRY 
The algorithm was tested with the symmetry problem, described in Rumelhart et 
al. The minimal solution for this task uses 2 hidden units. The simplest form of 
the algorithm does not actually find this minimal solution because some weights 
from the hidden units to the output unit can actually grow enough to compensate 
the low activations of the hidden units. However, a simple weight decay can 
prevent these weights from growing too much and allows the network to find the 
minimal solution. In this case, the total cost function being minimized simply 
becomes:

PHONETIC LABELING 
The algorithm was tested with a phonetic labeling task. The input patterns con- 
sisted of spectrograms (single speaker, 10x3.2ms spaced time frames, centered, 
16 frequencies)corresponding to 9 syllables [ba], [da], [ga], [bi], [di], [gi], and 
[bu], [du], [gu]. The task of the network was to classify these spectrograms (7 
tokens per syllable) into three categories corresponding to the three consonants 
lb], [g], and [g]. Starting with 12 hidden units, the algorithm reduced the net- 
work to 3 hidden units. (A hidden unit is considered unused when its activation 
over the entire range of patterns contributes very little to the activations of the 
output units). With standard back
