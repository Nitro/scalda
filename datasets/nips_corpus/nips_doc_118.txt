ABSTRACT 
Rumelhart (1987), has proposed a method for choosing minimal or 
simple representations during learning in Back-propagation 
networks. This approach can be used to (a) dynamically select the 
number of hidden units, Co) construct a representation that is 
appropriate for the problem and (c) thus improve the generalization 
ability of Back-propagation networks. The method Rumelhart suggests 
involves adding penalty terms to the usual error function. In this paper 
we introduce Rumelhart's minimal networks idea and compare two 
possible biases on the weight search space. These biases are compared 
in both simple counting problems and a speech recognition problem. 
In general, the constrained search does seem to minimize the number of 
hidden units required with an expected increase in local minima. 
INTRODUCTION 
Many supervised connectionist models use gradient descent in error to solve various 
kinds of tasks (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986). However, such gradient descent 
methods tend to be opportunisfic and can solve problems in an arbitrary way dependent 
on starting point in weight space and peculiarities of the training set. For example, in 
Figure 1 we show a mesh problem which consists of a random distribution of 
exemplars from two categories. The spatial geometry of the categories impose a meshed 
or overlapping subset of the exemplars in the two dimensional feature space. As the 
meshed part of the categories increase the problem becomes more complex and must 
involve the combination of more linear cuts in feature space and consequently more 
nonlinear cuts for category separation. In the top left comer of Figure l(a), we show a 
mesh geometry requiring only three cuts for category separation. In the bottom center

of this Figure l(c) is a typical solution provided by back-propagation starting with 16 
hidden units. This Figure shows the two dimensional feature space in which 9 of the 
linear cuts are projected (the other 7 are outside the [0,1] unit plane).

Examining the weights in the next layer of the network indicates that in fact, 7 of these 9 
line segments are used in order to construct the output surface shown in Figure 1CO). 
Consequently, the underlying feature relations determining the output surface and 
category separation are arbitrary, more complex then necessary and may restfit in 
anomalous generalizations. 
Rumelhart (1987), has proposed a way to increase the generalization capabilities of 
learning networks which use gradient descent methods and to automatically control the 
resources learning networks use-for example, in terms of hidden units. His hypothesis 
concerns the nature of the 'representation in the network: ...the simplest most robust 
network which accounts for a data set will, on average, lead to the best generalization to 
the population from which the training set has been drawn. 
The basic approach involves adding penalty terms to the usual error function in order to 
constrain the search and cause weights to differentially decay. This is similar to many 
proposals in statistical regression where a simplicity measure is minimized along with 
the error term and is sometimes referred to as biased regression (Rawlings, 1988). 
Basically, the s_atisfical concept of biased regression derives from parameter estimation 
approaches that attempt to achieve a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). By 
definition an unbiased estimator is one with the lowest possible variance and 
theoretically, unless there is significant collinearity  or nonlinearity amongst the 
1. For example, Ridge regression is a special case of biased regression which auempts to make a singular 
correlation matrix non-singular by adding a small arbitrary constant to the diagonal of the matrix. This 
increase in the diagonal may lower the impact of the off-diagonal elements and thus .duce the effects of

variables, a least squares estimator (LSE) can be also shown to be a BLUE. If on the 
other hand, input variables are correlated or nonlinear with the output variables (as is the 
case in back-propagation) then there is no guarantee that the LSE will also be unbiased. 
Consequently, introducing a bias may actually reduce the variance of the estimator of 
that below the theoretically unbiased estimator. 
Since back-propagation is a special case of multivariate nonlinear regression methods we 
must immediately give up on achieving a BLUE. Worse yet, the input variables are also 
very likely to be collinear in that input data are typically expected to be used for feature 
extraction. Consequently, the neural network framework leads naturally to the 
exploration of biased regression techniques, unfortunately, it is not obvious what sorts of 
biases ought to be introduced and whether they may be problem dependent. 
Furthermore, the choice of particular biases probably determines the particular 
representation that is chosen and its nature in terms of size, structure and simplicity. 
This representation bias may in turn induce generalization behavior which is greater in 
accuracy with larger coverage over the domain. Nonetheless, since there is no particular 
motivation for minimizing a least squares estimator it is important to begin exploring 
possible biases that would lead to lower variance and more robust estimators. 
In this paper we explore two general type of bias which introduce explicit constraints on 
the hidden units. First we discuss the standard back-propagation method, various past 
methods of biasing which have been called weight decay, the properties of our biases, 
and finally some simple benchmark tests using parity and a speech recognition task. 
BACK-PROPAGATION 
The Back-propagation method [2] is a supervised learning technique using a gradient 
descent in an error variable. The error is established by comparing an output value to a 
desired or expected value. These errors can be accumulated over the sample: 
e = - 
s i 
(1) 
Assuming the output function is differentiable then a gradient of the error can be found, 
and we require that this drivative be decreasing, 
-- =0. (2) 
Over multiple layers we pass back a weighted sum of each derivative from units above. 
WEIGHT DECAY 
Past work 2 using biases have generally been based on ad hoc arguments that weights 
should differentially decay allowing large weights to persist and small weights to tend 
180 Hanson and Pratt 
towards zero sooner. Apparently, this would tend to concentrate more of the input into a 
smaller number of weights. Generally, the intuitive notion is to somehow reduce the 
complexity of the network as defined by the number of connections and number of 
hidden units. A simple but inefficient way of doing this is to include a weight decay term 
in the usual delta updating rule causing all weights to decay on each learning step (where 
w = w 0 throughouO:

Solving this difference equation shows that for 
exponentially over steps towards zero, 
w,, = a  li (----)i +  Wo (4) 
i=1 
This approach inuoduces the decay term in the derivative itself causing error terms to 
also decrease over learning steps which may not be desirable. 
BIAS 
The sort of weight decay just discussed can also be derived from general consideration of 
costs on weights. For example it is possible to consider E with a bias term which in the 
simple decay case is quadratic with weight value (Le. w2). 
We now combine t/tis bias with E producing an objective function that includes both the 
error term and this bias function:

and related to the decay term and must be strictly < A for weight decay. 
Uniform weight decay has a disadvantage in that large weights are decaying at the same 
rate as small weights. It is possible to design biases that influence weights only when 
they are relatively small or even in a particular range of values. For example, Rumelhart 
has entertained a number of biases, one form in particular that we will also explore is 
based on a rectangular hyperbolic function,

understand its effect on the weight updates.

This derivative is plotled in Figure 2 (indicated as Rumelhart) and is non-monotonic 
showing a strong differential effect on small weights (+ or -) pushing them towards zero, 
while near zero and large weight values are not significantly affected. 
BIAS PER UNIT 
It is possible to consider bias on each hidden unit weight group. This has the potentially 
desirable effect of isol
