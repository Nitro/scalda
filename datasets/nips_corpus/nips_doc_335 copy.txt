Abstract 
We develop a new feedforward neural network representation of Lipschitz 
functions from [0, p]' into [0, 1] based on the level sets of the function. We 
show tha.t

is an upper bound on tile nulnber of nodes needed to represent f to within 
uniform error st, where L is the Lipschitz constant. ;Ve also show that the 
number of bits needed to represent the weights in the network in order to 
achieve this approximation is given by 
VZe conapare this bound with the e-entropy of the functional class under 
consideration. 
I INTRODUCTION 
We are concerned with tile problem of the number of nodes needed in a feedforward 
neural network in order to represent a function to within a specified accuracy. 
All results to date (e.g. [7, 10, 15]) have been in the form of existence theorems, 
stating that there does exist a neural network which achieves a certain accuracy of 
representation, but no indication is given of the number of nodes necessary in order 
to achieve this. The two teclmiques we use are the notion of e-entropy (also known

 ABSTRACT 
1. Determination of the general approximation properties of feedforward 
neural networks. (Non-constructive results of the form mentioned 
above [15].) 
2. Explicit constructive approximation theorems for feedforward neural 
networks, indicating the nmnber (or bounds on the number) of nodes 
needed to approxilnate a function from a given class to within a given 
accuracy. (This is the subject of the present paper. We are unaware of 
any other work along these lines apart frOlll [6].) 
3. Learning in general. That is, results on learning that are not dependent 
on the particular representation chosen. The exciting new results using 
the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dilnension [4, 9] fit into this category, as do 
studies on the use of Shortest Description Length principles [2]. 
4. Specific results on capabilities of learning in a given architecture [11]. 
5. Specific algorithms for learning in a specific architecture [14].

of a, function in terms of its level sets, which was used by Arnold [1]. The place of 
the current paper with respect to other works in the literature can be judged from 
table 1. 
We study the qnestion of representing a function f in the class ,(m,...,p,),r* which 
' L,C ' 
is the space of real valued functions deftlied on the n-dimensional closed interval 
)<i=110, fill with a Lipschitz constant L and bounded in absolute value by C. If

Pi -- P for i = 1 ., n, we denote the space , �.c'

where f is the approximation of f. 
2 e-ENTROPY OF FUNCTIONAL CLASSES 
The e-entropy 7-/, gives an indication of the nnlnber of bits required to represent 
with accuracy  an arbitrary function f in some functional class. It is defined as 
the logarithm to base 2 of the nnmber of elelnents in the smallest s-cover of the 
functional class. Kohnogorov [16] has proved that 
?-l r[,,c = B(n) (2) 
where B(n) is a constant which depends only on n. We use this result as a yardstick 
for our neural network representation. A more powerful result is [18, p.86]:

A NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTATION BASED 
ON LEVEL SETS 
We develop a new neural network architecture for representing functions from [0, 
onto [0, 1] (the restriction of the range to [0, 1] is just a convenience and can be 
easily dropped). The basic idea is to represent approximations f of the function 
f in terms of the level sets of f (see figure 1). Then neural networks are used to 
approximate the above sets (f) of f, where ?(f)  {x: f(x) >_ o} = >_o, l3(f) 
and la(f) is the a'th level set: lo(f) = {x: f(x) = a}. The approximations a(f) can 
�-Entropy and the Complexity of Feedforward Neural Networks 949 
be iml)lemented using three layer neural nets with threshold logic neurons. These 
approximations are of the form 
Isothetc approximation to the ruth component of [o.(f).

This theorem is proved in a straight-forward manner by taking account of all the 
errors incurred in the approximation of a worst-case function in 'P' 
Since comparing the number of nodes alone is inadequate for comparing the com- 
plexity of neural nets (because the nodes themselves could implement quite complex 
functions) we have also calculated the nulnber of bits needed to represent all of the 
weights (including zero weights which denote no colmection) in order to achieve an 
- approximation :1 
Theoreln 3 Tb.e number of bits needed to specify the weights in a neural network 
with the above architecture in order to represent an arbitrary function f   L,C 
with accuracy e,. in the sup-metric is bounded above by 
v4e,. ' (10) 
Equation 10 can be coinpared with (2) to see that the neural net representation is 
close to optimal. It is suboptimal by a factor of O(�). The v4 term is considered 
subsulned into the B(n) term in (2). 
1The idea of using the number of bits as a measure of network complexity has also 
recently been adopted in [5].

5 FURTHER WORK 
Theorem 3 shows that the colnplexity of representing an arbitrary f  .�,� is 
exponential in n. This is not so much a limitation of the neural network as an 
indication that our probleln is too hard. Theorem i shows that if smoothness 
constraints are tinposed, then the complexity can be considerably reduced. It is an 
open problem to determine whether the construction of the network presented in 
this paper can be extended to make good use of smoothness constraints. 
Of course the most important question is whether functions can be learned using 
neural networks. Apropos of this is Stone's result on rates of convergence in non- 
parametric regression [17]. Although we do not have space to give details here, 
suffice it say that he shows that the gains suggested by theorem 1 by imposing 
smoothness constraints in the representation problem, are also achievable in the 
learning problem. A more general statement of this type of result, making explicit 
the connexion with e-entropy is given by Yatracos [19]: 
Theorem 4 Let M be a L1-tolally bounded set of measures on a probability space. 
Let the metric defined on the space be the Ll-distance between measures. Then there 
exists a uniformly co.sislent estimalor i for some parameter 0 from a possibly 
infinite dimensional family of measures � C M whose rate of convergence in i 
asymptotically satisfies the equation 
a i -- 
(11) 
where 7-le(�) is the e-etvpy of�. 
Similar resnlts have been discussed by Ben-David et al. [3] (who have made use of 
Dudley's (loose) relationships between e-entropy and Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimen- 
sion IS]) and others [12, 13]. Tilere remain lnany open problems in this field. One of 
the lnain difficulties however is the calculation of?-/ for non-trivial function classes. 
One of tile lnost significant results would be a. complete and tight deterlnination of 
the e-entropy for a fcedforward neural network.
