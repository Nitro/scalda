Abstract 
A fast event-driven software simulator has been developed for sim- 
ulating large networks of spiking neurons and synapses. The prim- 
itive network elements are designed to exhibit biologically realis- 
tic behaviors, such as spiking, refractoriness, adaptation, axonal 
delays, summation of post-synaptic current pulses, and tonic cur- 
rent inputs. The efficient event-driven representation allows large 
networks to be simulated in a fraction of the time that would be 
required for a full compartmental-model simulation. Correspond- 
ing analog CMOS VLSI circuit primitives have been designed and 
characterized, so that large-scale circuits may be simulated prior 
to fabrication. 
1 Introduction 
Artificial neural networks typically use an abstraction of real neuron behaviour, 
in which the continuously varying mean firing rate of the neuron is presumed to 
carry the information about the neuron's time-varying state of excitation [1]. This 
useful simplification allows the neuron's state to be represented as a time-varying 
continuous-amplitude quantity. However, spike timing is known to be important in 
many biological systems. For example, in nearly all vertebrate auditory systems, 
spiral ganglion cells from the cochlea are known to phase lock to pure-tone stimuli 
for all but the highest perceptible frequencies [2]. The barn owl uses axonal delays 
to compute azimuthal spatial localization [3]. Studies in the cat [4] have shown that

relative timing of spikes is preserved even at the highest cortical levels. Studies in 
the visual system of the blowfly [5] have shown that the information contained in 
just three spikes is enough for the fly to make a decision to turn, if the visual input 
is sparse. 
Thus, it is apparent that biological neural systems exploit the spiking and time- 
dependent behavior of the neurons and synapses to perform system-level computa- 
tion. To investigate this type of computation, we need a simulator that includes 
detailed neural behavior, yet uses a signal representation efficient enough to allow 
simulation of large networks in a reasonable time. 
2 Spike: Event-Driven Simulation 
Spike is a fast event-driven simulator optimized for simulating networks of spiking 
neurons and synapses. The key simplifying assumption in Spike is that all currents 
injected into a cell are composed of piecewise-constant pulses (i.e., boxcar pulses), 
and therefore all integrated membrane voltage trajectories are piecewise linear in 
time. This very simple representation is capable of surprisingly complex and realistic 
behaviors, and is well suited for investigating system-level questions that rely on 
detailed spiking behavior. 
The simulator operates by maintaining a queue of scheduled events. The occurrence 
of one event (i.e., a neuron spike) usually causes later events to be scheduled in the 
queue (i.e., end of refractory period, end of post-synaptic current pulse). The total 
current injected into a cell is integrated into the future to predict the time of firing, 
at which time a neuron spike event is scheduled. If any of the current components 
being injected into the cell subsequently change, the spike event is rescheduled. The 
simulator runs until the queue is empty or until the desired run-time has elapsed. 
A similar event-driven neural simulator was developed by Pratt [6]. 
The simulator output may be plotted by a number of commercially available plotting 
programs, including Gnuplot, Mathematica, Xvgr, and Cview. 
3 NeuraLOG: Neural Schematic Capture 
NeuraLOG is a schematic entry tool, which allows the convenient entry of neural 
circuit diagrams, consisting of neurons, synapses, test inputs, and custom symbols. 
NeuraLOG is a customization of the program AnaLOG, by John Lazzaro and Dave 
Gillespie. 
The parameters of the neural elements are entered directly on the schematic dia- 
gram; these parameters include the neuron refractory period, duration and intensity 
of the post-synaptic current pulse following an action potential, saturation value of 
summating post-synaptic currents, tonic input currents, axonal delays, etc. Cus- 
tom symbols can be defined, so that arbitrarily complex hierarchical designs may 
be made. It is common to create a complex neuron containing many neuron and 
synapse primitive elements. Spiking inputs may be supplied as external stimuli for 
the circuit in a number of different formats, including single spikes, periodic spike 
trains, periodic bursts, poisson random spike trains, and gaussian-jittered periodic

spike trains. Textual input to Spike is also supported, to allow simulation of circuit 
topologies that would be too time-consuming to enter graphically. 
4 A Simple Example 
A simple example of a neural circuit is shown in Figure 1. This circuit consists of 
two neurons (the large disks), several synapses (the large triangles), and two tonic 
inputs (the small arrows). The text strings associated with each symbol define 
that symbol's parameters: neuron parameters are identifier labels (i.e., nl) and 
refractory period in milliseconds (ms); synapse parameters are the value of the post- 
synaptic current in nA, and the duration of the current pulse in ms, and an optional 
saturation parameter, which indicates how many post-synaptic current pulses may 
be superposed before saturation; the tonic input parameter is the injected current 
in nA. Filled symbols (tonic inputs and synapses) indicate inhibitory behavior.

tered in NeuraLOG. 
The simulated behavior of the circuit is shown in Figure 2. The neuron n! exhibits 
an adapting bursting behavior, as seen in the top trace of the plot. 
The excitatory tonic current input to neuron n! causes nl to fire repeatedly. The 
weakly excitatory synapse from n! to neuron n2 causes n2 to fire after many spikes 
from nl. The synaptic current in the synapse from n! to n2 is plotted in the trace 
labeled snln2. The strongly inhibitory synapse from n2 to n! causes n! to stop 
firing after n2 fires a spike. The synaptic current in the synapse from n2 to n! is 
plotted in the trace labeled sn2nl. The combination of the excitatory tonic input 
to n! and the inhibitory feedback from n2 to n! causes the bursting behavior. 
The adapting behavior is caused by the self-inhibitory accumulating feedback from 
neuron n! to itself, via the summating inhibitory synapse in the top left of the 
diagram. Each spike on n! causes a slightly increased inhibitory current into 
which gradually slows the rate of firing with each successive pulse. The synaptic 
current in this inhibitory synapse is plotted in the trace znlnl; it is similar to the

This simple example demonstrates that the summating synapse primitive can be 
used to model a behavior that is not strictly synaptic in origin; it can be thought 
of as a general time-dependent state variable. This example also illustrates the 
principle that proper network topology (summating synapse in a negative feedback 
loop) can lead to realistic system-level behavior (gradual adaptation), even though 
the basic circuit elements may be rather primitive (boxcar current pulses). 
5 Applications of the Simulation Tools 
NeuraLOG and Spike have been used by the author to model spiking associative 
memories, adaptive structures that learn to predict a time delay, and chaotic spiking 
circuits. Researchers at Caltech [7, 8] and the Salk Institute have used the tools in 
their studies of locust central pattern generators (CPGs) and cortical oscillations. 
The cortical oscillation circuits contain a few hundred neurons and a few thousand 
synapses. A CPG circuit, developed by Sylvie Ryckebusch, is shown in Figure 3; 
the corresponding simulation output is shown in Figure 4. 
NeuraLOG and Spike are distributed at no charge under the GNU licence. They 
are currently supported on HP and Sun workstations. The tools are supplied with 
a user's manual and working tutorial examples.

6 The Link to Analog VLSI 
Analog VLSI circuit primitives that can be modelled by Spike have been designed 
and tested. The circuits are shown in Figure 5, and have been described previously 
[9, 10]. These circuits have been used by workers at Caltech to implement VLSI 
models of central pattern generators. The software simulation tools allow simulation 
of complex neural circuits prior to fabrication, to improve the likelihood of success 
on first silicon, and to allow optimization of shared parameters (bias wires). 
7 Conclusion 
NeuraLOG and Spike fill a need for a fast neural simulator that can model large 
networks of biologically realistic spiking neurons. The simple computational prim- 
itives within Spike can be used to create complex and realistic neural behaviors 
in arbitrarily complex hierarchical designs. The tools are publicly available at no 
charge. NeuraLOG and Spike have been used by a number of research labs for
