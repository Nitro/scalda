Learning can increase the rate of evolution of a population of 
biological organisms (the Baldwin effect). Our simulations 
show that in a population of artificial neural networks 
solving a pattern recognition problem, no learning or too 
much learning leads to slow evolution of the genes whereas 
an intermediate amount is optimal. Moreover, for a given 
total number of training presentations, fastest evoution 
occurs if different individuals within each generation receive 
different numbers of presentations, rather than equal 
numbers. Because genetic algorithms (GAs) help avoid 
local minima in energy functions, our hybrid learning-GA 
systems can be applied successfully to complex, high- 
dimensional pattern recognition problems. 
INTRODUCTION 
The structure and function of a biological network derives from both its 
evolutionary precursors and real-time learning. Genes specify (through 
development) coarse attributes of a neural system, which are then refined 
based on experience in an environment containing more information -- and

more unexpected information than the genes alone can represent. Innate 
neural structure is essential for many high level problems such as scene 
analysis and language [Chomsky, 1957]. 
Although the Central Dogma of molecular genetics [Crick, 1970] implies 
that information learned cannot be directly transcribed to the genes, such 
information can appear in the genes through an indirect Darwinian process 
(see below). As such, learning can change the rate of evolution the 
Baldwin effect [Baldwin, 1896]. Hinton and Nowlan [1987] considered a 
closely related process in artificial neural networks, though they used 
stochastic search and not learning per se. We present here analyses and 
simulations of a hybrid evolutionary-learning system which uses gradient- 
descent learning as well as a genetic algorithm, to determine network 
connections. 
Consider a population of networks for pattern recognition, where initial 
synaptic weights (weights at birth) are determined by genes. Figure 1 
shows the Darwinian fitness of networks (i.e., how many patterns each can 
correctly classify) as a function the weights. Isoofitness contours are not 
concentric, in general. The tails of the arrows represent the synaptic 
weights of networks at birth. In the case of evolution without learning, 
network B has a higher fitness than does ,, and thus would be 
preferentially selected. In the case of gradient-descent learning before 
selection, however, network , has a higher after-learning fitness, and 
would be preferentially selected (tips of arrows). Thus learning can change 
which individuals will be selected and reproduce, in particular favoring a 
network (here, ,) whose genome is good (i.e., initial weights close to 
the optimal), despite its poor performance at birth. Over many generations, 
the choice of better genes for reproduction leads to new networks which 
require less learning to solve the problem they are closer to the optimal. 
The rate of gene evolution is increased by learning (the Baldwin effect).

synaptic weight space. The black region 
corresponds to perfect classifications 
(fitness = 5). The weights of two 
networks are shown at birth (tails of 
arrows), and after learning (tips of 
arrows). At birth, B has a higher fitness 
score (2) than does ,, (1); a pure genetic 
algorithm (without learning) would 
preferentially reproduce B. With 
learning, though, , has a higher fitness 
score (4) than B (2), and would thus be 
preferentially reproduced. Since ,,'s 
genes are better than B's, learning can 
lead to selection of better genes.

Surprisingly, too much learning leads to slow evolution of the genome, 
since after sufficient training in each generation, all networks can perform 
perfectly on the pattern recognition task, and thus are equally likely to pass 
on their genes, regardless of whether they are good or bad. In Figure 
1, if both A and B continue learning, eventually both will identify all five 
patterns correctly. B will be just as likely to reproduce as A, even though 
's genes are better. Thus the rate of evolution will be decreased too 
much learning is worse than an intermediate amount or even no 
learning. 
SIMULATION APPROACH 
Our system consists of a population of 200 networks, each for classifying 
pixel images of the first five letters of the alphabet. The 9 x 9 input grid is 
connected to four 7 x 7 sets of overlapping 3 x 3 orientation detectors; 
each detector is fully connected by modifiable weights to an output layer 
containing five category units (Fig. 2). 
trainable 
weights 
Figure 2: Individual network architecture. The 9x9 pixel input is detected by each of 
four orientation selective input layers (7x7 unit arrays), which are fully connected by 
trainable weights to the five category units. The network is thus a simple perceptron 
with 196 (=4x7x7) inputs and 5 outputs. Genes specify the initial connection strengths. 
Each network has a 490obit gene specifying the initial weights (Figure 3). 
For each of the 49 filter positions and 5 categories, the gene has two bits 
Evolution and Learning in Neural Networks 807 
which specify which orientation is initially most strongly connected to the 
category unit (by an arbitrarily chosen factor of 3:1). During training, the 
weights from the filters to the output layer are changed by (supervised) 
perceptron learning. Darwinian fitness is given by the number of patterns 
correctly classified after training. We use fitness-proportional reproduction 
and the standard genetic algorithm processes of replication, mutation, and 
cross-over [Holland, 1975]. Note that while fitness may be measured after 
training, reproduction is of the genes present at birth, in accord with the 
Central Dogma. This is not a Lamarkian process.

Figure 3: The genetic representation of a network. For each of the five category units, 
49 two-bit numbers describe which of the four orientation units is most strongly 
connected at each position within the 7x7 grid. This unit is given a relative connection 
strength of 3, while the other three orientation units at that position are given a relative 
strength of 1. 
For a given total number of teaching presentations, reproductive fitness 
might be defined in many ways, including categorization score at the end of 
learning or during learning; such functions will lead to different rates of 
evolution. We show simulations for two schemes: in uniform learning each 
network received the same number (e.g., 20) of training presentations; in 
808 Keesing and Stork 
distributed learning networks received a randomly chosen number (10, 34, 
36, 16, etc.) of presentations. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 4 shows the population average fitness at birth. The lower curve 
shows the performance of the genetic algorithm alone; the two upper curves 
represent genetypic evolution the amount of information within the genes 
when the genetic algorithm is combined with gradient-descent learning. 
Learning increases the rate of evolution both uniform and distributed 
learning are significantly better than no learning. The fitness after learning 
in a generation (not shown) is typically only 5% higher than the fitness at 
birth. Such a small improvement at a single generation cannot account for 
the overall high performance at later generations. A network's performance 
even after learning -- is more dependent upon its ancestors having 
learned than upon its having learned the task.

Figure 4: Learning guides the rate of 
evolution. In uniform learning, every 
network in every generation receives 20 
learning presentations; in the distributed 
learning scheme, any network receives a 
number of patterns randomly chosen 
between 0 and 40 presentations (mean = 
20). Clearly, evolution with learning 
leads to superior genes (fitness at birth) 
than evolution without learning. 
Figure 5: Selectivity of learning- 
evolution interactions. Too little or too 
much learning leads to slow evolution 
(population fitness at birth at generation 
100) while an intermediate amount of 
learning leads to significantly higher such 
fitness. This effect is significant in both 
learning schemes. (Each point represents 
the mean of five simulation runs.)

Figure 5 illustrates the tuning of these leaming-evolution interactions, as 
discussed above: too little or too much learning leads to poorer evolution 
than does an intermediate amount of learning. Given excessive learning 
(e.g., 500 presentations) all networks perform perfectly. This leads to the 
slowest evolution, since selection is independent of the quality of the genes. 
Note too in Fig. 4 that distributed learning leads to significantly faster 
evolution (higher fitn
