Abstract 
We have investigated the properties of neurons in inferior temporal (IT) 
cortex in monkeys performing a pattern matching task. Simple back- 
propagation networks were trained to discriminate the various stimulus 
conditions on the basis of the measured neuronal signal. We also trained 
networks to predict the neuronal response waveforms from the spatial pat- 
terns of the stimuli. The results indicate that IT neurons convey tempo- 
rally encoded information about both current and remembered patterns, 
as well as about their behavioral context.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Anatomical and neurophysiological studies suggest that there is a cortical pathway 
specialized for visual object recognition, beginning in the primary visual cortex 
and ending in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex (Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982). 
Studies of IT neurons in awake behaving lnonkeys have found that visually elicited 
responses depend on the pattern of the stimulus and on the behavioral context of 
the stimulus presentation (Richmond and Sato, 1987; Miller et al, 1991). Until now, 
however, no attempt had been made to quantify the temporal pattern of firing in 
the context of a behaviorally complex task such as pattern recognition. 
Our goal was to examine the information present in IT neurons about visual stimuli 
and their behavioral context. We explicitly allowed for the possibility that this 
information was encoded in the temporal pattern of the response. To decode the 
responses, we used simple feed-forward networks trained by back propagation. 
In work reported elsewhere (Eskandar et al, 1991) this information is calculated 
another way, with similar results. 
2 THE EXPERIMENT 
Two monkeys were trained to perform a sequential nonmatch to sample task using 
a complete set of 32 black-amid-white patterns based on 2-D Walsh functions. While 
the monkey fixated and grasped a bar, a sample pattern appeared for 352 msecs; 
after a pause of 500 msecs a test stimulus appeared for 352 msecs. The monkey 
indicated whether the test stimulus failed to match the sample stimulus by releasing 
the bar. (If the test matched the stimulus, the monkey waited for a third stimulus, 
different from the sample, before releasing the bar; see Fig. 1.)

The type of trial (match or nonmatch) and the pairings of sample stimuli with 
nonmatch stimuli were selected randomly. A single experiment usually contained 
several thousand trials; thus each of the 32 patterns appeared repeatedly under the 
three conditions (sample, match, and nonmatch). Single neuron recordings from IT 
cortex were carried out while the monkeys were performing the task.

Fig. 2 shows the neuronal signals produced by two different stimulus patterns in 
the three behavioural conditions: sample, match and nonmatch. The lower parts 
of the figure show single-trial spike trains, while the upper parts show the effective

each spike with a Gaussian kernel, adding these up for each trial and averaging the 
resulting continuous signals over trials. It is evident that for a given stimulus pattern 
the average signals produced in different behavioural conditions are different. In 
what follows, we proceed further to show that there is information about behavioural 
condition in the signal produced in a single trial. We will compute its average value 
explicitly. 
3 DECODING NETWORKS 
To compute this information we trained networks to decode the measured signal. 
The form of the network is shown in Fig. 3.

condition. 
The first two layers of the network shown preprocess the spike trains as follows: We 
begin with the spikes measured in an interval starting 90 msec after the stimulus 
onset and lasting 256 msec. First each spike is convolved with a Gaussian kernel 
to produce a continuous signal. This signal is sampled at 4-msec intervals, giving a 
64-dimensional input vector. In the second step this input vector is compressed by 
throwing out all but a small number of its principal components (PC's). The PC 
basis was obtained by diagonalizing the 64 x 64 covariance matrix of the inputs 
computed over all trials in the experiment. The remaining PC's are then the input 
to the rest of the network, which is a standard one with one further hidden layer. 
Earlier work showed that the first five PC's transmit most of the pattern information 
in a neuronal response (Richmond et al, 1987). Furthermore, the first PC is highly 
correlated with the spike count. Thus, our subsequent analysis was either on the 
first PC alone, as a measure of spike count, or on the first five PC's, as a measure 
2360 Eskandar, Richmond, Hertz, Optican, and Kjar 
that incorporates temporal modulation. 
We trained the networks to make pairwise discriminations between responses 
measured under different conditions (sample-match, sample-nonmatch, or match- 
nonmatch). Thus there is a single output unit, and the target is a i or 0 according 
to the behavioural condition under which that spike train was measured. 
The final two layers of the network were trained by standard backpropagation of 
errors for the cross-entropy cost function 
E--' T'log ). +(1-T)l�g 1-O(x') ' (1) 
where Tu is the target and 0  the network output produced by the input vector 
x' for training example y. The output of the network with the weights that result 
from this training is then the optimal estimate (given the chosen architecture) of 
the probability of a behavioural condition, given the menured neuronal signal used 
 input. The number of hidden units w adjusted to minimize the generalization 
error, which w computed on one quarter of the data that w reserved for this 
purpose. 
We then calculated the mean equivocation, 
 = -(O(x)og(O() + [ - O()] og[ - O()]), (2) 
where O(x) is the value of the output unit for input x and the average is over all 
inputs. (We calculated this by averagng over the test or [raining sets; the results 
were not sensitive to which one we chose.) The equivocation is a meure of the 
neuron's uncertainty with respect [o a given discrinfina[ion. From it we can compute 
the transmitted information 
I = I. vioi - e = 1 - e. (3) 
The 1[ equality follows because in our daa sets the two conditions always occur 
equally often. 
It is evident from Fig. 2 that if we already know that our signal is produced by a 
particular stimulus pattern, the discrimination of the behavioural condition will be 
eier than if we do not possess this a pori knowledge. This is because the signal 
varies with stimulus  well  behavioural condition (more strongly, in fact), and 
the dependence on the latter h [o be sorted out from that on the former. To 
get an idea of the effect of this distraction, we performed 4 separate calculations 
for each of the 3 behavioural-condition discrinations, using 1, 4, 8, and all 32 
simulus paterns, respectively. 
The results are summarized in Fig. 4, which shows the transmitted information 
about the 3 different behavioural-condition discriminations at the various levels of 
distraction, averaged over 5 cells. It also indicates how much of the transmitted 
information in each ce is contained in the spike count alone (i.e. the first PC of 
the signal). 
I[ is apparent that meurable information about behavioural condition is present 
in a single neuronal response, even in the total absence of a pno information about 
the stimulus pattern. It  also evident [hat most of this information is contained in

the time-dependence of the firing: the information contained in the first PC of the 
signal is significantly less (paired t-test p < 0.001) and was barely out of the noise. 
A finite data set can lead to a biased estimate of the transmitted information (Op- 
tican et al, 1991). In order to control for this we made a preliminary study of 
the dependence of the calculated equivocation on training set size. We varied the 
number of trials available to the network in a range (64 - 1024) for one pair of 
discriminations (sample vs. nonmatch). The calculated apparent equivocation in- 
creased with the sample size N, indicating a small-sample bias. The best correlation 
(Pearson r = -0.86) was obtained with a fit of the form: 
e(N) = coo -cN -/ (c > 0). (4) 
This gives us a systematic way to estimate the small-sample bias and thus provide an 
improved estimate e of the true equivocation. Details will be reported elsewhere.
