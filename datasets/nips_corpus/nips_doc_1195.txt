Abstract 
We couple the tasks of source separation and density estimation 
by extracting the local geometrical structure of distributions ob- 
tained from mixtures of statistically independent sources. Our 
modifications of the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm results 
in purely digital learning rules which perform non-parametric his- 
togram density estimation. The non-parametric nature of the sep- 
aration allows for source separation of non-linear mixtures. An 
anisotropic coupling is introduced into our $OM with the role of 
aligning the network locally with the independent component con- 
tours. This approach provides an exact verification condition for 
source separation with no prior on the source distributions. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Much of the current work on visual cortex modeling has focused on the generation of 
coding which captures statistical independence and sparseness (Bell and Sejnowski 
1996, Olshausen and Field 1996). The Bell and $ejnowski model suffers from the 
parametric and intrinsically non-local nature of their source separation algorithm, 
while the Olshausen and Field model does not achieve true sparse-distributed cod- 
ing where each cell has the same response probability (Field 1994). In this paper, we 
construct an extensively modified SOM with equipartition of activity as a steady- 
state for the task of local statistical independence processing and sparse-distributed 
coding.

Ritter and Schulten (1986) demonstrated that the density of the Kohonen SOM 
units is not proportional to the input density in the steady-state. In one dimen- 
sion the Kohonen net under-represents high density and over-represents low den- 
sity regions. Thus SOM's are generally not used for density estimation. Several 
modifications for controlling the magnification of the representation have appeared. 
Recently, Bauer et. al. (1996) used an adaptive step size , and Lin and Cowan 
(1996) used an Lp-norm weighting to control the magnification. Here we concen- 
trate on the later's faithful representation algorithms for source separation and 
density estimation. 
2 SHARPLY PEAKED DISTRIBUTIONS 
Mixtures of sharply peaked source distributions will contain high density contours 
which correspond to the independent component contours. Blind separation can be 
performed rapidly for this case in a net with one dimensional branched topology. A 
digital learning rule where the updates only take on discrete values was used:  
Ai =/A(e) � sgn( - i), (1) 
where n is the learning rate, A(e) the neighborhood function, {3} the SOM unit 
positions, and 'the input.

We performed source separation and coding of two mixed signals in a net with the 
topology of two cross-linked branches (see Fig. (1)). The neighborhood function

A(e) is taken to be Gaussian where e is the distance to the winning unit along the 
branch structure. Two speech audio files were randomly mixed and pre-whitened 
first to decorrelate the two mixtures. Since pre-whitening tends to orthogonalize 
the independent component axes, much of the processing that remains is rotation 
to find the independent component coordinate system. A typical simulation is 
shown in Fig. (1). The branches of the net quickly zero in on the high density 
directions. As seen from the nearest-neighbor Voronoi partition of the distribution 
(Fig. lb), the branched SOM essentially performs a one dimensional equipartition of 
the mixture. The learning rule Eqn. I attempts to place each unit at the component- 
wise median of the distribution encompassed by its Voronoi partition. For sharply 
peaked sources, the algorithm will place the units directly on top of the high density 
ridges. 
To demonstrate the generality of our non-parametric approach, we perform source 
separation and density coding of a non-linear mixture. Because our network has 
local dynamics, with enough units, the network can follow the curved independent 
component contours of the input distribution. The result is shown in Fig. (2). 
Figure 2: Source separation of non-linear mixture. The mixture is given by  = 
-2sgn(s). s + 1.1s - s2, 2 - -2sgn(s). s + s + 1.1s. Left: the SOM 
configuration is shown periodically in the figure, with the configuration after 12000 
points indicated by the dots. Dashed lines denote two independent component 
contours. Right: the sources (s, s), mixtures (, ) and pseudo-histogram- 
equalized representations (o, o). 
To unmix the input, a parametric separation approach can be taken where least 
squares fit to the branch contours is used. For the source separation in Fig. (la), 
assuming linear mixing and inserting the branch coordinate system into an unmix- 
ing matrix, we find a reduction of the amplitudes of the mixtures to less than one 
percent of the signal. This is typical of the quality of separation obtained in our 
simulations. For the non-linear source separation in Fig. (2), parametric unmix- 
ing can similarly be accomplished by least squares fit to polynomial contours with

quadratic terms. Alternatively, taking full advantage of the non-parametric nature 
of the SOM approach, an approximation of the independent sources can be con- 
structed from the positions w-'/. of the winning unit. Or as we show in Fig. (2b), the 
cell labels i* can be used to give a pseudo-histogram-equalized source representa- 
tion. This non-parametric approach is thus much more general in the sense that no 
model is needed of the mixing transformation. Since there is only one winning unit 
along one branch, only one output channel is active at any given time. For sharply 
peaked source distributions such as speech, this does not significantly hinder the 
fidelity of the source representation since the input sources hover around zero most 
of the time. This property also has the potential for utilization in compression. 
However, for a full rigorous histogram-equalized source representation, we must 
turn to a network with a topology that matches the dimensionality of the input. 
3 ARBITRARY DISTRIBUTIONS 
For mixtures of sources with arbitrary distributions, we seek a full N dimensional 
equipartition. We define an (M, N) partition of R S to be a partition of R S into 
(M q- 1) N regions by M parallel cuts normal to each of N distinct directions. The 
simplest equipartition of a source mixtures is the trivial equipartition along the 
independent component axes (ICA). Our goal is to achieve this trivial ICA aligned 
equipartition using a hypercube architecture SOM with M q- 1 units per dimension. 
For an (M, N) equipartition, since the number of degrees of freedom to define the 
MN hyperplanes grows quadratically in N, while the number of constraints grows 
exponentially in N, for large enough M the desired trivial equipartition will the 
unique (M, N) equipartition. We postulate that M - 2 suffices for uniqueness. 
Complementary to this claim, it is known that a (1, N) equipartition does not exist 
for arbitrary distributions for N _ 5 (Ramos 1996). The uniqueness of the (M, N) 
equipartition of source mixtures thus provides an exact verification condition for 
noiseless source separation.

Equipartion of the input distribution can easily be shown to be a steady-state of 
the dynamics. Let qg be the probability measure of unit /. For the steady-state:

=  q. A('- )- sgn(r- fz) + qg y. A(/ -/-')- sgn(fc - r) 
= Y].(q'- qr)' A(r- ;)-sgn(r- fz), 
for all units ;. By inspection, equipartition, where q = q/ for all units  is a 
solution to the equation above. It h been shown that equipartition is the only

steady-state of the learning rule in two dimensional rectangular SOM's (Lin and 
Cowan 1996), though with the highly overconstrained steady-state equations, the 
result should be much more general. 
One further modification of the SOM is required. The desired trivial ICA equipar- 
tition is not a proper Voronoi partition except when the independent component 
axes are orthogonal. To obtain the desired equipartition, it is necessary to change 
the definition of the winning unit i '. Let 
() = {( ' r* = r} (5) 
be the winning region of the unit at w-'i-. Since a histogram-equalized representation 
independent of the mixing transformation A is desired, we require that

i.e.,  is equivariant under the action of A (see e.g. Golubitsky 1988).

In two dimensions, we modify the tessellation by dividing up a primitive cell amongst 
its constituent units along lines joining the midpoints of the sides. For a primitive 
cell composed of units at G, b'*, ' and d the region of the primitive cell represented 
by G is the
