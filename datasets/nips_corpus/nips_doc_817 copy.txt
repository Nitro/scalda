Abstract 
Dynamic programming provides a methodology to develop planners 
and controllers for nonlinear systems. However, general dynamic 
programming is computationally intractable. We have developed 
procedures that allow more complex planning and control problems 
to be solved. We use second order local trajectory optimization 
to generate locally optimal plans and local models of the value 
function and its derivatives. We maintain global consistency of the 
local models of the value function, guaranteeing that our locally 
optimal plans are actually globally optimal, up to the resolution of 
our search procedures. 
Learning to do the right thing at each instant in situations that evolve over time is 
difficult, as the future cost of actions chosen now may not be obvious immediately, 
and may only become clear with time. Value functions are a representational tool 
that makes the consequences of actions explicit. Value functions are difficult to 
learn directly, but they can be built up from learned models of the dynamics of the 
world and the cost function. This paper focuses on how fast optimizers that only 
produce locally optimal answers can play a useful role in speeding up the process 
of computing or learning a globally optimal value function. 
Consider a system with dynamics Xkq-1 -- f(xk, uk) and a cost function L(xk, uk),

where x is the state of the system and u is a vector of actions or controls. The sub- 
script k serves as a time index, but will be dropped in the equations that follow. A 
goal of reinforcement learning and optimal control is to find a policy that minimizes 
the total cost, which is the sum of the costs for each time step. One approach to 
doing this is to construct an optimal value function, V(x). The value of this value 
function at a state x is the sum of all future costs, given that the system started in 
state x and followed the optimal policy P(x) (chose optimal actions at each time 
step as a function of the state). A local planner or controller can choose globally 
optimal actions if it knew the future cost of each action. This cost is simply the 
sum of the cost of taking the action right now and the future cost of the state that 
the action leads to, which is given by the value function.

Value functions are difficult to learn. The environment does not provide training 
examples that pair states with their optimal cost (x, V(x)). In fact, it seems that the 
optimal policy depends on the optimal value function, which in turn depends on the 
optimal policy. Algorithms to compute value functions typically iteratively refine 
a candidate value function and/or a corresponding policy (dynamic programming). 
These algorithms are usually expensive. We use local optimization to generate 
locally optimal plans and local models of the value function and its derivatives. We 
maintain global consistency of the local models of the value function, guaranteeing 
that our locally optimal plans are actually globally optimal, up to the resolution of 
our search procedures. 
I A SIMPLE EXAMPLE: A PENDULUM 
In this paper we will present a simple example to make our ideas clear. Figure 1 
shows a simulated set of locally optimal trajectories in phase space for a pendulum 
being driven by a motor at the joint from the stable to the unstable equilibrium 
position. S marks the start point, where the pendulum is hanging straight down, 
and G marks the goal point, where the pendulum is inverted (pointing straight up). 
The optimization criteria quadratically penalizes deviations from the goal point 
and the magnitude of the torques applied. In the three locally optimal trajectories 
shown the pendulum either swings directly up to the goal (1), moves initially away 
from the goal and then swings up to the goal (2), or oscillates to pump itself and 
then swing to the goal (3). In what follows we describe how to find these locally 
optimal trajectories and also how to find the globally optimal trajectory. 
2 LOCAL TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION 
We base our local optimization process on dynamic programming within a tube 
surrounding our current best estimate of a locally optimal trajectory (Dyer and 
McReynolds 1970, Jacobson and Mayne 1970). We have a local quadratic model 
of the cost to get to the goal (V) at each time step along the optimal trajectory 
(assume a time step index k in everything below unless otherwise indicated):

A locally optimal policy can be computed using local models of the plant (in this 
case local linear models) at each time step along the trajectory: 
Xk+l = f(x, u)  Ax + Bu + c (3) 
and local quadratic models of the one step cost at each time step along the trajec- 
tory: 
L(x, u)  -x T qx + -1 urRu + xTSu + tTu (4)

At each point along the trajectory the optimal policy is given by: 
u �pt = -(R + BZVxxB) -1 x 
(BzVxAx + SZx + BrV,,c + V,B + t) 
One can integrate the plant dynamics forward in time based on the above policy, 
and then integrate the value functions and its first and second spatial derivatives 
backwards in time to compute an improved value function, policy, and trajectory.

3 STANDARD DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING 
A typical implementation of dynamic programming in continuous state spaces dis- 
cretizes the state space into cells, and assigns a fixed control action to each cell. 
Larson's state increment dynamic programming (Larson 1968) is a good example 
of this type of approach. In Figure 2A we see the trajectory segments produced by 
applying the constant action in each cell, plotted on a phase space for the example 
problem of swinging up a pendulum.

USING LOCAL TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION 
WITH DP 
We want to minimize the number of cells used in dynamic programming by making 
the cells as large as possible. Combining local trajectory optimization with dynamic 
programming allows us to greatly reduce the resolution of the grid on which we do 
dynamic programming and still correctly estimate the cost to get to the goal from 
different parts of the space. Figure 2A shows a dynamic programming approach 
in which each cell contains a trajectory segment applied to the pendulum problem. 
Figure 2B shows our approach, which creates a set of locally optimal trajectories 
to the goal. By performing the local trajectory optimizations on a grid and forcing 
adjacent trajectories to be consistent, this local optimization process becomes a 
global optimization process. Forcing adjacent trajectories to be consistent means 
requiring that all trajectories can be generated from a single underlying policy. 
A trajectory can be made consistent with a neighbor by using the neighboring 
trajectory as an initial trajectory in the local optimization process, or by using the 
value function from the neighboring trajectory to generate the initial trajectory in 
the local optimization process. Each grid element stores the trajectory that starts 
at that point and achieves the lowest cost. 
The trajectory segments in figure 2A match the trajectories in 2B. Figures 2C and 
2D are low resolution versions of the same problem. Figure 2C shows that some 
of the trajectory segments are no longer correct. In Figure 2D we see the locally 
optimal trajectories to the goal are still consistent with the trajectories in Figure 2B. 
Using locally optimal trajectories which go all the way to the goal as building blocks 
for our dynamic programming algorithm allows us to avoid the problem of correctly 
interpolating the cost to get to the goal function on a sparse grid. Instead, the cost 
to get to the goal is measured directly on the optimal trajectory from each node to 
the goal. We can use a much sparser grid and still converge.

ADAPTIVE GRIDS BASED ON CONSTANT COST 
CONTOURS 
We can limit the search by growing the volumes searched around the initial and 
goal states by gradually increasing a cost threshold C a. We will only consider states 
around the goal that have a cost less than C a to get to the goal and states around 
the initial state that have a cost less than C a to get from the initial state to that 
state (Figure 3B). These two regions will increase in size as C a is increased. We stop

increasing C a as soon as the two regions come into contact. The optimal trajectory 
has to be entirely within the union of these two regions, and has a cost of 2Ca. 
Instead of having the initial conditions of the trajectories laid out on a grid over the 
whole space, the initial conditions are laid out on a grid over the surface separating 
the inside and the outside surfaces of the volumes described above. The resolution 
of this grid is adaptively determined by checking whether the value function of one 
trajectory correctly predicts the cost of a neighboring trajectory. If it does not, 
additional grid points are added between the inc
