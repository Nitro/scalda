Abstract 
Stochastic gradient descent is a general algorithm which includes LMS, 
on-line backpropagation, and adaptive k-means clustering as special cases. 
The standard choices of the learning rate /(both adaptive and fixed func- 
tions of time) often perform quite poorly. In contrast, our recently pro- 
posed class of search then converge learning rate schedules (Darken and 
Moody, 1990) display the theoretically optimalasymptotic convergence rate 
and a superior ability to escape from poor local minima. However, the user 
is responsible for setting a key parameter. We propose here a new method- 
ology for creating the first completely automatic adaptive learning rates 
which achieve the optimal rate of convergence. 
Introduction 
The stochastic gradient descent algorithm is 
XW(t) = -Vw :(W(t),X(t)). 
where r/is the learning rate, t is the time, and X(t) is the independent random 
exemplar chosen at time t. The purpose of the algorithm is to find a parameter 
vector W which minimizes a function G(W) which for learning algorithms has the 
form �xE(W, X), i.e. G is the average of an objective function over the exemplars, 
labeled E and X respectively. We can rewrite AW(t) in terms of G as 
xw(t) = -.[VwG(W(t)) + w(t))], 
where the  are independent zero-mean noises. Stochastic gradient descent may be 
preferable to deterministic gradient descent when the exemplar set is increasing in 
size over time or large, making the average over exemplars expensive to compute.

Additionally, the noise in the gradient can help the system escape from local minima. 
The fundamental algorithmic issue is how to best adjust 7 as a function of 
time and the exemplars? 
State of the Art Schedules 
The usual non-adaptive choices of 7 (i.e. 7 depends on the time only) often yield 
poor performance. The simple expedient of taking 7 to be constant results in 
persistent residual fluctuations whose magnitude and the resulting degradation of 
system performance are difficult to anticipate (see fig. 3). Taking a smaller constant 
7 reduces the magnitude of the fluctuations, but seriously slows convergence and 
causes problems with metastable local minima. Taking 7(t) - c/t, the common 
choice in the stochastic approximation literature of the last forty years, typically 
results in slow convergence to bad solutions for small c, and parameter blow-up for 
small t if c is large (Darken and Moody, 1990). 
The available adaptive schedules (i.e. 7 depends on the time and on previous exem- 
plars) have problems as well. Classical methods which involve estimating the hes- 
sian of G are often unusable because they require O(N 2) storage and computation 
for each update, which is too expensive for large N (many parameter systems-- 
e.g. large neural nets). Methods such as those of Fabian (1960) and gesten (1958) 
require the user to specify an entire function and thus are not practical methods 
as they stand. The delta-bar-delta learning rule, which was developed in the con- 
text of deterministic gradient descent (Jacobs, 1988), is often useful in locating the 
general vicinity of a solution in the stochastic setting. However it hovers about the 
solution without converging (see fig. 4). A schedule developed by Urasiev is proven 
to converge in principle, but in practice it converges slowly if at all (see fig. 5). The 
literature is widely scattered over time and disciplines, however to our knowledge 
no published O(N) technique attains the optimal convergence speed. 
Search-Then-Converge Schedules 
Our recently proposed solution is the search then converge learning rate schedule. 
7 is chosen to be a fixed function of time such as the following: 
l+! 
7(0 = 70 
c t t  
This function is approximately constant with value 70 at times small compared to v 
(the search phase). At times large compared with v (the converge phase), the 
function decreases as c/l. See for example the eta vs. time curves for figs. 6 and 
7. This schedule has demonstrated a dramatic improvement in convergence speed 
and quality of solution as compared to the traditional fixed learning rate schedule 
for k-means clustering (Darken and Moody, 1990). However, these benefits apply 
to supervised learning as well. Compare the error curve of fig. 3 with those of figs. 
6 and 7. 
This schedule yields optimally fast asymptotic convergence if c > c*, c* --_ 1/2a, 
where a is the smallest eigenvalue of the hessian of the function G (defined above)

at the pertinent minimum (Fabian, 1968) (Major and Revesz, 1973) (Goldstein, 
1987). The penalty for choosing c < c* is that the ratio of the excess error given c 
too small to the excess error with c large enough gets arbitrarily large as training 
time grows, i.e. 
lim Ec<c. 
teo Ec>c. 
where E is the excess error above that at the minimum. The same holds for the 
ratio of the two distances to the location of the minimum in parameter space. 
While the above schedule works well, its asymptotic performance depends upon 
the user's choice of c. Since neither /0 nor r affects the asymptotic behavior of 
the system, we will discuss their selection elsewhere. Setting c > c*, however, 
is vital. Can such a c be determined automatically? Directly estimating ( with 
conventional methods (by calculating the smallest eigenvalue of the hessian at our 
current estimate of the minimum) is too computationally demanding. This would 
take at least O(N 2) storage and computation time for each estimate, and would 
have to be done repeatedly (N is the number of parameters). We are investigating 
the possibility of a low complexity direct estimation of ( by performing a second 
optimization. However here we take a more unusual approach: we shall determine 
whether c is large enough by observing the trajectory of the parameter (or weight) 
vector. 
On-line Determination of Whether c < c* 
We propose that excessive correlation in the parameter change vectors (i.e. drift) 
indicates that c is too small (see fig. 1). We define the drift as 
v(t) = 
k 
d(t) -- 
[((Sk(t) -- (Sk(t))T)2)T] 1/2 
where 5 (t) is the change in the kth component of the parameter vector at time t and 
the angled brackets denote an average over T parameter changes. We take T = at, 
where a << 1. Notice that the numerator is the average parameter step while the

denominator is the standard deviation of the steps. As a point of reference, if the 5 
were independent normal random variables, then the d: would be T-distributed 
with T' degrees of freedom, i.e. approximately unit-variance normals for moderate 
to large T. We find that 5: may also be taken to be the kth component of the noisy 
gradient to the same effect. 
Asymptotically, we will take the learning rate to go as c/t. Choosing c too small 
results in a slow drift of the parameter vector towards the solution in a relatively 
linear trajectory. When c > c* however, the trajectory is much more jagged. Com- 
pare figs. 7 and 8. More precisely, we find that D(t) blows up like a power of t 
when c is too small, but remains finite otherwise. Our experiments confirm 
this (for an example, see fig. 2). This provides us with a signal to use in future 
adaptive learning rate schemes for ensuring that c is large enough. 
The bold-printed statement above implies that an arbitrarily small change in c which 
moves it to the opposite side of c*'has dramatic consequences for the behavior of the 
drift. The following rough argument outlines how one might prove this statement, 
focusing on the source of this interesting discontinuity in behavior. We simplify the 
argument by taking the &:'s to be gradient measurements as mentioned above. We 
consider a one-dimensional problem, and modify d to be /(5)Z (i.e. we ignore 
the denominator). Then since T = at as stated above, we approximate

in distribution to the well-known Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (fig. 2) when c > c*. 
By extending this work, one can show that X(t) converges in distribution to a 
deterministic power law, t p with p > 0 when c < c*. Since the 's are independent 
and have uniformly bounded variances for smooth objective functions, the second 
term converges in distribution to a finite-variance random variable. The first term 
converges to a finite-variance random variable if c > c*, but to a power of t if c < c*. 
Qualitative Behavior of Schedules

problem. Notice the difficulties that are encountered by some schedules even on a 
fairly easy problem due to n
