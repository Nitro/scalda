Abstract 
We present a new way to derive dissipative, optimizing dynamics from 
the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics. It can be used to obtain both 
standard and novel neural net dynamics for optimization problems. To 
demonstrate this we derive standard descent dynamics as well as nonstan- 
dard variants that introduce a computational attention mechanism. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Neural nets are often designed to optimize some objective function E of the current 
state of the system via a dissipative dynamical system that has a circuit-like imple- 
mentation. The fixed points of such a system are locally optimal in E. In physics the 
preferred formulation for many dynamical derivations and calculations is by means 
of an objective function which is an integral over time of a Lagrangian function, 
L. From Lagrangians one usually derives time-reversable, non-dissipative dynamics 
which cannot converge to a fixed point, but we present a new way to circumvent 
this limitation and derive optimizing neural net dynamics from a Lagrangian. We 
apply the method to derive a general attention mechanism for optimization-based 
neural nets, and we describe simulations for a graph-matching network.

LAGRANGIAN FORMULATION OF NEURAL 
DYNAMICS 
Often one must design a network with nontrivial temporal behaviors such as run- 
ning longer in exchange for less circuitry, or focussing attention on one part of a 
77 
78 Mjolsness and Miranker 
problem at a time. In this section we transform the original objective function (c.f. 
[Mjolsness and Garrett, 1989]) into a Lagrangian which determines the detailed dy- 
namics by which the objective is optimized. In section 3.1 we will show how to add 
in an extra level of control dynamics. 
2.1 THE LAGIt, ANGIAN 
Replacing an objective E with an associated Lagrangian, L, is an algebraic trans- 
formation: 
dE 
E[v] - LE ,vl 1 - K[,vl 1 + d-q-' 
The action S = f_ Ldt is to be extremized in a novel way: 
5S/56i(t) = 0 (i.e.OL/Ovi(t) = 0). 
(1) 
(2) 
In (1), q is an optional set of control parameters (see section 3.1) and K is a cost- 
of-movement term independent of the problem and of E. For one standard class of 
neural networks, 
[vl = -(/)  v,v -  a,v, +  ,(v,) (3) 
so 
where g- 
-- OE/Ovi = E jvj + hi - g-l(vi), 
l(v) = 4'(v). Also dE/dr is of course y4(OE/Ovi)6i.

2.2 THE GREEDY FUNCTIONAL DERIVATIVE 
In physics, Lagrangian dynamics usually have a conserved total energy which pro- 
hibits convergence to fixed points. Here the main difference is the unusual func- 
tional derivative with respect to 6 rather than v in equation (2). This is a greedy 
functional derivative, in which the trajectory is optimized from beginning to each 
time t by choosing an extremal value of v(t) without considering its effect on any 
subsequent portion of the trajectory:

2.3 STEEPEST DESCENT DYNAMICS

2.4 HOPFIELD/GIOSSBERG DYNAMICS 
With a suitable K one may recover the analog neuron dynamics of Hopfield (and 
Grossberg): 
L = E g'(u,) + E v vi' vi m g(ui). (10)

o�/oai(t) = 0  ai + oz/o, = 0, i.e. 
() 
itl = -OE/Ovi and vi = g(ui). (12) 
We conjecture that this function K[iq, ui] is optimal in a certain sense: if we lin- 
earize the u dynamics and consider the largest and smallest eigenvalues, extremized 
separately over the entire domain of u, with -T constrained to have bounded pos- 
itive eigenvalues, then the ratio of such largest and smallest eigenvalues is minimal 
for this K. This criterion is of practical importance because the largest eigenvalue 
should be bounded for circuit implementability, and the smallest eigenvalue should 
be bounded away from zero for circuit convergence in finite time.

We note a change of variable which simplifies the kinetic energy term in the above 
dynamics, for use in the next section:

3 APPLICATION TO COMPUTATIONAL ATTENTION 
We can introduce a computational attention mechanism for neural nets as follows. 
Suppose we can only afford to simulate A out of N >> A neurons at a time in a 
large net. We shall do this by simulating A real neurons indexed by a  { 1... A), 
corresponding to a dynamically chosen subset of the N virtual neurons indexed 
byi {1...N). 
3.0.1 Constraints 
In great generality, the correspondance 
matrix of control parameters 
qia = ria  [0, 1] 
Zi 'ia ---- 1, 
 r _< 1. 
can be chosen dynamically via a sparse 
constrained so that 
(16) 
Alternatively, the r variables can be coordinated to describe a window or focus 
of attention by taking rid to be a function of a small number of parameters q 
specifying the window, which are adjusted to optimize /[r[q]]. This procedure, 
which can result in significant economies, was used for our computer experiments. 
3.0.2 Neuron Dynamics 
The assumed control relationship is 
= 
(17) 
i.e. virtual neuron wi follows the real neuron to which r assigns it. Equation (15) 
then determines ui(t) and v(t). A plausible kinetic energy term for k is the same 
A Lagrangian Approach to Fixed Points 81 
as for w (c.f. equation (13)), since that choice (equivalent to the Hoplield case) has 
a good eigenvalue ratio for the u variables. The Lagrangian for the real neurons 
becomes 
1 . OE . 
a ia 
and the equations of motion (greedy variation) may be shown to be 
(18) 
(19) 
3.1 CONTROL DYNAMICS FOR ATTENTION 
Now we need dynamics for the control parameters r or more generally q. An objec- 
tive function transformation (proposed and subjected to preliminary experiments in 
[Mjolsness, 1987]) can be used to construct a new objective for the control parame- 
ters, q, which rewards speedy convergence of the original objective E as a function 
of the original variables v by measuring dE/dr: 
E[v] - k[q] = b(dE/dt) + co, t[q] 
= b[Ei(0z/0vi)] + 
(20) 
where b is a monotonic, odd function that can be used to limit the range of . We 
can calculate dE/dr from equations (17) and (19): 
OE . OE 
benefit(r) ---- b() - b ria--wika = -b ria gvvi ' 
(21) 
where OE/Ovi = j 7}jvj + hi - ui. If we assume that cost favors fixed points 
for which ria  0 or 1 and i ria -, 0 or 1, there is a fixed-point-preserving 
transformation of (21) to 
benefit(r) ---- -b riagt(lq )( vi ) . 
(22) 
This is monotonic in a linear function of r. It remains to specify cost and a kinetic 
energy term K. 
3.2 INDEPENDENT VIRTUAL NEURONS 
First consider independent ria. As in the Tank-Hopfield [Tank and Hopfield, 1986] 
linear programming net, we could take 
o =   , - 1 + r ,- 1 + 0(,). (2a) 
a ' 
Thus the r dynamics just sorts the virtual neurons and chooses the A neurons 
with largest g(ui)OE/Ovi. For dynamics, we introduce a new time variable r that 
82 Mjolsness and Miranker 
may not even be proportional to t (see figure lb) and imitate the Lagrangians for 
Hopfield dynamics: 
ia 
and 
(2) 
3.3 JUMPING WINDOW OF ATTENTION 
A far more cost-effective net involves partitioning the virtual neurons into real-net- 
sized blocks indexed by c, so i - (c, a) where a indexes neurons within a block. 
Let X  [0, 1] indicate which block is the current window or focus of attention, i.e. 
Using (22), this implies 
(27) 
and 
1 
= 1) + 
(28) 
Since /co,r here favors Ea Xa = I and X e {0, 1}, benefit has the same fixed 
points as, and can be replaced by, 
(29) 
Then the dynamics for X is just that of a winner-take-all neural net among the blocks 
which will select the largest value of b[a g'(uc,,)(OE/Ov,,)]. The simulations of 
Section 4 report on an earlier version of this control scheme, which selected instead 
the block with the largest value of ]], [OE/Ovo,,[. 
3.4 IOLLING WINDOW OF ATTENTION 
Here the r variables for a neural net embedded in a d-dimensional space are deter- 
mined by a vector x representing the geometric position of the window. Ecost can be 
dropped entirely, and E can be calculated from r(x). Suppose the embedding is via 
a d-dimensional grid which for notational purposes is partitioned into window-sized 
squares indexed by integer-valued vectors c and a. Then 
r,a, = 6aw(La + a- x), 
(30)

The advantage of (30) over, for example, a jumping or sliding window of attention 
is that only a small number of real neurons are being reassigned to new virtual 
neurons at any one time.
