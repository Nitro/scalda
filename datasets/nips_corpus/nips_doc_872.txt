Abstract 
This paper describes a way of neural hardware 
implementation with the analog-digital mixed mode neural 
chip. The full custom neural VLSI of Universally 
Reconstructible Artificial Neural network(URAN) is used 
to implement Korean speech recognition system. A 
multi-layer perceptron with linear neurons is trained 
successfully under the limited accuracy in computations. 
The network with a large frame input layer is tested to 
recognize spoken korean words at a forward retrieval. 
Multichip hardware module is suggested with eight chips 
or more for the extended performance and capacity.

1 INTRODUCTION 
In general, the neural network hardware or VLSI has been preferred in 
respects of its relatively fast speed, huge network size and effective cost 
comparing to software simulation. Universally Reconstructible Artificial 
Neural-network(URAN), the new analog-digital mixed VLSI neural 
network, can be used for the implementation of the real world neural 
network applications with digital interface. The basic electronic synapse 
circuit is based on the electrically controlled MOSFET resistance and is 
operated with discrete pulses. 
The URAN's adaptability is tested for the multi-layer perceptron with 
the reduced precision of connections and states. The linear neuron 
function is also designed for the real world applications. The multi-layer 
network with back propagation learning is designed for the speaker 
independent digit/word recognition. The other case of application is for 
the servo control, where the neural input and output are extended to 
360 levels for the suitable angle control. With the servo control 
simulation, the flexibility of URAN is proved to extend the accuracy of 
input and output from external. 
2. Analog-Digital Mixed Chip - URAN 
In the past, there have been improvements in analog or analog-digital 
mixed VLSI chips. Analog neural chips or analog-digital mixed neural 
chips are still suffered from the lack of accuracy, speed or flexibility. 
With the proposed analog-digital mixed neural network circuit of U-RAN, 
the accuracy is improved by using the voltage-controlled linear 
MOSFET resistance for the synapse weight emulation. The speed in 
neural computation is also improved by using the simple switch 
controlled by the neural input as described in previous works. 
The general flexibility is attained by the independent characteristic of 
each synapse cell and the modular smacmre of URAN chip. As in Table 
1 of URAN chip feature, the chip is operated under the flexible control, 
that is, the various mode of synaptic connection per neuron or the 
extendable weight accuracy can be implemented. It is not limited for the 
asynchronous/direct interchip expansion in size or speed. In fact, 16 fully 
connected module of URAN is selected from external and independently 
- it is possible to select either one by one or all at once.

As all circuits over the chip except digital decoder unit are operated in 
analog transistor level, the computation speed is relatively high and even 
can be improved substantially. The cell size including interconnection 
area in conventional short-channel technology is reduced less than 900  
m 2. From its expected and measured linear characteristic, URAN has the 
accuracy more than 256 linear levels. 
The accuracy extendability and flexible modularity are inherent in 
electrical wired-OR characteristics as each synapse is an independent 
bipolar current source with switch. No additional clocking or any limited 
synchronous operation is required in this case, while it is indispensible 
in most of conventional digital neural hardware or analog-digital neural 
chip. Therefore, any size of neural network can be integrated in VLSI 
or module hardware merely by placing the cell in 2 dimensional array 
without any timing limitation or loading effect. 
3. Neural Hardware with URAN - Module Expansion 
URAN is the full custom VLSI of analog-digital mixed operation. The 
prototype of URAN chip is fabricated in 1.0/ digital CMOS technology. 
The chip c9ntains 135,424 synapses with 8 bit weight accuracy on a 13 
X 13 mm z die size using single poly double metal technology. As 
summarized in Table 1 of chip features, the chip allows the variety of 
configuration. In the prototype chip, 16 fully connected module of 92 X 
92 can be selected from external and independently - selecting 
independent module either one by one, several or all at a time is 
possible. 
With URAN's synapse circuit of linear voltage-controlled bipolar current 
source, the synaptic multiplication with weight value is done with the 
switching transistor, in a similar way of analog-sampled data type. The 
accuracy enhancement and flexible modularity of URAN are inherent in 
its electrical wired-OR interface from each independent bipolar current 
source. And the neural network hardware module can be realized in 
any size with the multi [RAN chips. 
4. Considerations on the Reduced Precision 
URAN chip is applied for the case of Korean speaker independent 
speech recognition. By changing numbers of hidden units and input 
accuracy, the result of simulations has not shown any problems in 
recognition accuracy. It means that the overall performance is not 
severely affected from the accuracy of weight, input, and output with 
URAN. Also, it was possible to train with 2 or 1 decimal accuracy for 
input and output, which is equivalent to 8 bit or 4 bit precisions. With 
20 hidden units for the Korean spoken 10 digit recognition, 2 decimal 
input accuracy yields 99.2% and 1 'decimal input accuracy yields 98.6%,

while binary 1-bit input results 96.6%. 
The following is the condition for the experimentation. The general 
result is summarized in Table 2.

In case of servo control, the digital VCR for industrial purpose is 
modelled for the application. Six inputs are used to minimize the 
number of hidden units and 20 hidden units are configured for one 
output. For the adaptation to URAN, the linear neuron function is used 
during the simulation. The weight accuracy during the learning phase 
using conventional computer is 4 byte and that in the recall phase using 
URAN chip is 1 byte. With this limitation, the overall performance is 
not severely degraded, that is, the reduction of error is attained up to 
70% improvement comparing to the conventional method. The nonideal 
factor of 30�.4 results from the limitation in learning data as well as the 
limited hardware. Current results are suitable for the digital VCR or 
compact camcoder in noisy environment

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, it is proved to be suitable for the application to the 
multi-layer perceptron with the use of URAN chip, which is fabricated 
in conventional digital CMOS technology - 1.0/ single poly double 
metal. The reduced weight accuracy of 1 byte is proved to be enough 
to obtain high performance using the linear neuron and URAN. 
With 8 test chips of 135,424 connections, it is now under development of 
the practical module of neural hardware with million connections and 
tera connections per second - comparable to the power of biological 
neuro-system of some insects. The size of the hardware is smaller than 
A4 size and is designed for more general recognition system. The 
flexible modularity of URAN makes it possible to realize a 1,000,000 
connections neural chip in 0.5/ CMOS technology and a general purpose 
neural hardware of hundreds of tera connections or more.
