Abstract 
During visual development, projections from retinal ganglion cells 
(RGCs) to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in cat are refined to 
produce ocular dominance layering and precise topographic mapping. 
Normal development depends upon activity in RGCs, suggesting a key 
role for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Recent experiments on 
prenatal retina show that during early development, waves of activity 
pass across RGCs (Meister, et al., 1991). We provide the first 
simulations to demonstrate that such retinal waves, in conjunction with 
Hebbian synaptic competition and early arrival of contralateral axons, 
can account for observed patterns of retinogeniculate projections in 
normal and experimentally-treated animals. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
During the development of the mammalian visual system, initially diffuse axonal inputs 
are refined to produce the precise and orderly projections seen in the adult. In the lateral 
geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the cat, projections arriving from retinal ganglion cells 
(RGCs) of both eyes are initially intermixed, and they gradually segregate before birth to 
form alternating layers containing axons from only one eye. At the same time, the 
branching patterns of individual axons are refined, with increased growth in 
topographically correct locations. Axonal segregation and refinement depends upon

presynaptic activity -- blocking such activity disrupts normal development (Sretavan, et 
al., 1988; Shatz & Stryker, 1988). These and findings in other vertebrates (Cline, et al., 
1987) suggest that synaptic plasticity may be an essential factor in segregation and 
modification of RGC axons (Shatz, 1990). 
Previous models of visual development based on synaptic plasticity (Miller, et al., 1989; 
Whitelaw & Cowan, 1981) required an assumption of spatial correlations in RGC activity 
for normal development. This assumption may have been justified for geniculocortical 
development, since much of this occurs postnatally: visual stimulation provides the 
correlations. The. assumption was more difficult to justify for retinogeniculate 
development, since this occurs prenatally  before any optical stimulation. 
The first strong evidence for correlated activity before birth has recently emerged in the 
retinogenculate system: wave-like patterns of synchronized activity pass across the 
prenatal retina, generating correlations between neighboring cells' activity (Meister, et al., 
1991). We believe our model is the first to incorporate these important results. 
We propose that during visual development, projections from both eyes compete to 
innervate LGN neurons. Contralateral projections, which reach the LGN earlier, may 
have a slight advantage in competing to innervate cells of the LGN located farthest from 
the optic tract. Retinal waves of activity could reinforce this segregation and improve the 
precision of topographic mapping by causing weight changes within the same eye -- and 
particularly within the same region of the same eye -- to be highly correlated. Unlike 
similar models of cortical development, our model does not require lateral interactions 
between post-synaptic cells -- available evidence suggests that lateral inhibition is not 
present during early development (Shotwell, et al., 1986). Our model also incorporates 
axon growth  an essential aspect of retinogeniculate development, since the growth and 
branching of axons toward their ultimate targets occurs simultaneously with synaptic 
competition. Moreover, synaptic competition may provide cues for growth (Shatz & 
Stryker, 1988). We consider the possibility that diffusing intracellular signals indicating 
local synaptic strength guide axon growth. 
Below we present simulations which show that this model can account for development 
in normal and experimentally-treated animals. We also predict the outcomes of novel 
experiments currently underway. 
2 SIMULATIONS 
Although the LGN is, of course, three-dimensional, in our model we represent just a 
single two-dimensional LGN slice, ten cells wide and eight cells high. The retina is then 
one-dimensional: 50 cells long in our simulations. (This ratio of widths, 50/10, is 
roughly that found in the developing cat.) In order to eliminate edge effects, we wrap 
the retina into a ring; likewise we wrap the LGN into a cylinder. 
Development of projections to the LGN is modelled in the following way: projections 
from all fifty RGCs of the contralateral eye arrive at the base of the LGN before those of 
the ipsilateral eye. A very rough topographic map is imposed, corresponding to coarse 
topography which might be supplied by chemical gradients (Wolpert, 1978). 
Development is then modelled as a series of growth steps, each separated by a period of 
Hebb-style synaptic competition (Wigstrom & Gustafson, 1985). During competition, 
synapses are strengthened when pre- and post-synaptic activity are sufficiently conelated, 
Retinogeniculate Development: The Role of Competition and Correlated Retinal Activity 93 
and they are weakened otherwise. More specifically, for a given RGC cell i with activity 
a i, the strength of synapse wij to LGN cell j is changed according to: 
Aw ij=� (a i - 0t) (aj - ) [1] 
where  and I are threshholds and � a learning rate. If a wave of retinal activity is 
present, the activity of RGC cells is determined as a probability of firing based on a 
Gaussian function of the distance from the center of the wavefront. LGN cell activity is 
equal to the sum of weighted inputs from RGC cells. 
After each wave, the total synaptic weight supported by each RGC cell i is renormalized 
linearly: 
wij (t) 
wij(t+l)= w 
ik (t) [2] 
k 
The weights supported by each LGN cell are also renormalized, gradually driving them 
toward some target value T: 
wij (t+ 1)=w ij (t)+ [T- Wkj (t)] 
k [3] 
Renormalization reflects the notion that there is a limited amount of synaptic weight 
which can be supported by any neuron. 
During growth steps, connections are modified based on the strength of neighboring 
synapses from the same RGC cell. After normalization, connections grow or retract 
according to: 
wij (t+ 1)= wij (t)+ '  Wik(t) 
neighbors [4] 
where , is a constant term. Equation 4 shows that weights in areas of high synaptic 
strength will increase more than those elsewhere. 
3 RESULTS 
Synaptic competition, in conjunction with waves of pre-synaptic activity and early arrival 
of contralateral axons, can account for pattens of growth seen in normal and 
experimentally-treated animals. In the presence of synaptic competition, modelled axons 
from each eye segregate to occupy discrete layers of the LGN -- precisely what is seen in 
normal development. In the absence of competition, as in treatment with the drug TTX, 
axons arborize throughout the LGN (Figure 1). 
The segregation and refinement of retinal inputs to the LGN is best illustrated by the 
formation of ocular dominance patterns and topographic ordering. In simulations of 
normal development, where retinal waves are combined with early arrival of contalateral 
inputs, strong ocular dominance layers are formed: LGN neurons farthest from the optic 
tract receive synaptic inputs solely from the contralateral eye and those closer receive only 
ipsilateral inputs (Figure2, Competition). The development of these ocular dominance 
patterns is gradual: early in development, a majority of LGN neurons receive inputs from 
both eyes. When synaptic competition is eliminated, there is no segregation into eye- 
specific layers .... LGN neurons receive significant synaptic inputs from both eyes. These 
results are consistent with labelling studies of cat development (Shatz & Stryker, 1988).

absence of such competition (bottom), contralateral and ipsilateral projections are diffuse; 
there is no discernible ocular dominance pattern. During simulations, projections are 
represented by synapses throughout the LGN slice, shown as squares; the particular 
arborization patterns shown above are inferred from related simulations.

Figure 2: Ocular dominance at the end of development. Dark color indicates strongest 
synapses from the contralateral eye, light indicates strongest synapses from ipsilateral, 
and gray indicates significant synapses from both eyes. In the presence of competition, 
LGN cells segregate into eye-specific layers, with the contralateral eye dominating cells 
which are farthest from the optic tract (base). When competition is eliminated (No 
Competition), as in the addition of the drug TTX, there is no segregation into layers and 
LGN cells receive significant inputs from both eyes. These simulations reproduced 
results from cat development. When inputs from both retinae arrive simultaneously 
(Simultaneous), ocular dominance patches are established, similar to those observed in 
normal conical development.
