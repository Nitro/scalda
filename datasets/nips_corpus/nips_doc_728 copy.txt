Abstract 
We present a Mean Field Theory method for locating two- 
dimensional objects that have undergone rigid transformations. 
The resulting algorithm is a form of coarse-to-fine correlation 
matching. We first consider problems of matching synthetic point 
data, and derive a point matching objective function. A tractable 
line segment matching objective function is derived by considering 
each line segment as a dense collection of points, and approximat- 
ing it by a sum of Gaussians. The algorithm is tested on real images 
from which line segments are extracted and matched. 
I Introduction 
Assume that an object in a scene can be viewed as an instance of the model placed 
in space by some spatial transformation, and object recognition is achieved by dis- 
covering an instance of the model in the scene. Two tightly coupled subproblems 
need to be solved for locating and recognizing the model: the correspondence prob- 
lem (how are scene features put into correspondence with model features?), and the 
localization problem (what is the transformation that acceptably relates the model 
features to the scene features?). If the correspondence is known, the transformation 
can be determined easily by least squares procedures. Similarly, for known trans- 
formation, the correspondence can be found by aligning the model with the scene, 
or the problem becomes an assignment problem if the scene feature locations are 
jittered by noise.

Several approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. Some tree-pruning 
methods [1, 3] make hypotheses concerning the correspondence by searching over 
a tree in which each node represents a partial match. Each partial match is then 
evaluated through the pose that best fits it. In the generalized Hough transform or 
equivalently template matching approach [7, 3], optimal transformation parameters 
are computed for each possible pairing of a model feature and a scene feature, and 
these optimal parameters then vote for the closest candidate in the discretized 
transformation space. 
By contrast with the tree-pruning methods and the generalized Hough transform, we 
propose to formulate the problem as an objective function and optimize it directly 
by using Mean Field Theory (MFT) techniques from statistical physics, adapted as 
necessary to produce effective algorithms in the form of analog neural networks. 
2 Point Matching 
Consider the problem of locating a two-dimensional model object that is believed 
to appear in the scene. Assume first that both the model and the scene are 
represented by a set of points respectively, {xi} and {Ya}- The problem is to 
recover the actual transformation (translation and rotation) that relates the two 
sets of points. It can be solved by minimizing the following objective function 
Ematch(Mia,O,t) ----- E Mia[[xi- ILoYa - t[[ 2 
ia 
(1) 
where {Mi,} = M is a 0/1-valued match matrix representing the unknown cor- 
respondence, R0 is a rotation matrix with rotation angle 0, and t is a translation 
vector. 
2.1 Constraints on match variables 
We need to enforce some constraints on correspondence (match) variables Mia; 
otherwise all Mia = 0 in (1). Here, we use the following constraint 
= _> 0; (2) 
ia 
implying that there are exactly N matches among all possible matches, where N 
is the number of the model features. Summing over permutation matrices obeying 
this constraint, the effective objective function is approximately [5]: 
1 
F(O, t,/) - - E e-/511x'-ReY-tll' (3) 
a 
which has the same fixed points as 
1 
Spena,ty(U,/, t) -- Eraarch(M,/, t) +  E Mia(log Mia - 1), (4) 
where Mi is treated as a continuous variable and is subject to the penalty function 
z(log z - 1).

Figure 1: Assume that there is only translation between the model and the scene, 
each containing 20 points. The objective functions at at different temperatures 
(/-1): 0.0512 (top left), 0.0128 (top right), 0.0032 (bottom left) and 0.0008 (bot- 
tom right), are plotted as energy surfaces of x and y components of translation. 
Now, let $ = 1/2rr 2 and write 
Epont(O, t) =  e- 'x'-R'Y -t (5) 
ia 
The problem then becomes that of maximizing Epoint, which in turn can be interpre- 
tated as minimizing the Euclidean distance between two Gaussian-blurred images 
containing the scene points xi and a transformed version of the model points ya. 
Tracking the local maximum of the objective function from large a to small a, as in 
deterministic annealing and other continuation methods, corresponds to a coarse- 
to-fine correlation matching. See Figure 1 for a demonstration of a simpler case in 
which only translation is applied to the model. 
2.2 The descent dynamics 
A gradient descent dynamics for finding the saddle point of the effective objective 
function F is 
 -- -mia(Xi - RoYa - t) 
ia 
 = -  -a(x - l0y - t/(l0+y), 
ia 
(6) 
988 Lu and Mjolsness 
where rnia -- {Mia}/ = e -llx'-Ry-tll2 is the soft correspondence associated 
with Mia. Instead of updating t by descent dynamics, we can also solve for t 
directly. 
3 The Vernier Network 
Though the effective objective is non-convex over translation at low temperatures, 
its dependence on rotation is non-convex even at relatively high temperatures. 
3.1 Hierachical representation of variables 
We propose overcoming this problem by applying Mean Field Theory (MFT) to a 
hierachical representation of rotation resulting from the change of variables [4] 
B-1 
0 = Xb(Ob +0b), 0  [--0,01, (7) 
b=0 
where 0 = r/2B,  = (b + �) are the constant centers of the intervals, and 0 
are fine-scale vernier variables. The X's are binary variables (so Xb G {0, 1}) that 
satisfy the winner-take-all (WTA) constraint  X - 1. 
The essential reason that this hierarchical representation of 0 has fewer spurious 
local minima than the conventional analog representation is that the change of 
variables also changes the connectivity of the network's state space: big jumps in 0 
can be achieved by local variations of X-

4 Line Segment Matching 
In many vision problems, representation of images by line segments has the ad- 
vantage of compactness and subpixel accuracy along the direction transverse to the 
line. However, such a representation of an object may vary substantially from image 
to image due to occlusions and different illumination conditions. 
4.1 Indexing points on line segements 
The problem of matching line segments can be thought of as a point matching 
problem in which each line segment is treated as a dense collection of points. Assume 
now that both the scene and the model are represented by a set of line segments 
respectively, {si} and {ma}. Both the model and the scene line segments are

represented by their endpoints as si: (pi,Pti) and ma -- (qa, qt,), where pi,Pti, 
and qa, q[ are the endpoints of the ith scene segment and the ath model segment, 
respectively. The locations of the points on each scene segment and model segments 
can be parameterized as 
x i = si(u) = 
Ya = ma(v) = 
Pi + u(p'i - pi), u 6 [0, 1] and (11) 
qa q- v(q'. --qa), V C [0, 1]. (12) 
Now the model points and the scene points can be though of as indexed by i = 
(i, u) and a = (a, v). Using this indexing, we have Ei  El lifO 1 dt and Ea c< 
, I, fo 1 dv, where li = IIPi-p'll and l = Ilq,-q'll. The point matching objective 
function (5) can be specialized to line segment matching as [5] 
/01f01 
Eseg(0, t): lila e 2211s'()-Rm*(v)-tl12du dv. (13) 
ia 
As a special case of point matching objective function, (13) can readily be trans- 
formed to the vernier network previously developed for point matching problem.

ax = 3 = 0.0929032,  = 0.237033, cx = 1 - ca = 0.116807, and c = 0.5.
