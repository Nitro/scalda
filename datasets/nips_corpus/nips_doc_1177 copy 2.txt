Abstract 
This paper shows how the prices of option contracts traded in finan- 
cial markets can be tracked sequentially by means of the Extended 
Kalman Filter algorithm. I consider call and put option pairs with 
identical strike price and time of maturity as a two output nonlin- 
ear system. The Black-Scholes approach popular in Finance liter- 
ature and the Radial Basis Functions neural network are used in 
modelling the nonlinear system generating these observations. I 
show how both these systems may be identified recursively using 
the EKF algorithm. I present results of simulations on some FTSE 
100 Index options data and discuss the implications of viewing the 
pricing problem in this sequential manner. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Data from the financial markets has recently been of much interest to the neural 
computing community. The complexity of the underlying macro-economic system 
and how traders react to the flow of information leads to highly nonlinear rela- 
tionships between observations. Further, the underlying system is essentially time 
varying, making any analysis both difficult and interesting. A number of prob- 
lems, including forecasting a univariate time series from past observations, rating 
credit risk, optimal selection of portfolio components and pricing options have been 
thrown at neural networks recently. 
The problem addressed in this paper is that of sequential estimation, applied to 
pricing of options contracts. In a nonstationary environment, such as financial 
markets, sequential estimation is the natural approach to modelling. This is because 
data arrives at the modeller sequentially, and there is the need to build and apply the 
Sequential Tracking of Financial Option Prices 961 
best possible model with available data. At the next point in time, some additional 
data is available and the task becomes one of optimally updating the model to 
account for the new data. This can either be done by reestimating the model with 
a moving window of data or by sequentially propagating the estimates of model 
parameters and some associated information (such as the error covariance matrices 
in the Kalman filtering flamework discussed in this paper). 
2 SEQUENTIAL ESTIMATION 
Sequential estimation of nonlinear models via the Extended Kalman Filter algo- 
rithm is well known (e.g. Candy, 1986; Bar-Shalom & Li, 1993). This approach 
has also been widely applied to the training of Neural Network axchitectures (e.g. 
Kadirkamanathan & Niranjan, 1993; Puskorius & Feldkamp, 1994). In this section, 
I give the necessary equations for a second order EKF, i.e. Taylor series expansion 
of the nonlinear output equations, truncated at order two, for the state space model 
simplified to the system identification framework considered here. 
The parameter vector or state vector, 0, is assumed to have the following simple 
random walk dynamics. 
0_(n+l) = 0_(n) + u(n), 
where u(n) is a noise term, known as process noise. u(n) is of the same dimension- 
ality as the number of states used to represent the system. The process noise gives 
a random walk freedom to the state dynamics facilitating the tracking behaviour 
desired in nonstationary environments. In using the Kalman filtering framework, 
we assume the covariance matrix of this noise process, denoted Q, is known. In 
practice, we set Q to some small diagonal matrix. 
The observations from the system are given by the equation 
_() = _f(0, _V) + w(), 
where, the vector z(n) is the output of the system consisting of the call and put 
option prices at time n. U denotes the input information. In the problem considered 
here, U consists of the price of the underlying asset and the time to maturity if the 
option. w is known as the measurement noise, covaxiance matrix of which, denoted 
R, is also assumed to be known. Setting the paxameters R and Q is done by trial 
and error and knowledge about the noise processes. In the estimation framework 
considered here, Q and R determine the tracking behaviour of the system. For the 
experiments reported in this paper, I have set these by trial and error, but more 
systematic approaches involving multiple models is possible (Niranjan eta/, 1994). 
The prior estimates at time (n + 1), using all the data upto time (n) and the model 
of the dynamical system, or the prediction phase of the Kalman algorithm is given 
by the equations: 
(n4- l[n) = (n[n)

where J-0 and H0 are the Jacobian and Hessians of the output z_; also no = 2. e i 
are unit vectors in direction i. tr(.) denotes trace of a matrix. The posterior esti-

(- + 11- + 1) = (. + 11-) + :(- + 1)v(. + 1)

3 BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL 
The Black-Scholes equation for calculating the price of an European style call option 
(Hull, 1993) is 
where, 
C = S .]V'(dl) -- X e-r ;m .]V'(d2) ' 
ln(S/X) + (r +-5-)tv/ 
dl = 
d2 = dl - rr tv/ 
Here, C is the price of the call option, $ the underlying asset price, X the strike 
price of the option at maturity, t, the time to maturity and r is the risk free interest 
rate. a is a term known as volatility and may be seen as an instantaneous variance 
of the time variation of the asset price. Af(.) is the cumulative normal function. 
For a derivation of the formula and the assumptions upon which it is based see 
Hull, 1993. Readers unfamiliar with financial terms only need to know that all the 
quantities in the above equation, except a, can be directly observed. a is usually 
estimated from a small moving window of data of about 50 trading days. 
The equivalent formula for the price of a put option is given by 
P = -S.Af(-dl) + X e- ' tm Af(-d2), 
For recursive estimation of the option prices with this model, ! assume that the 
instantaneous picture given by the Black $choles model is correct. The state vector 
is two dimensional and consists of the volatility a and the interest rate r. The 
Jacobian and Hessian required for applying EKF algorithm are

4 NEURAL NETWORK MODELS 
The data driven neural network model considered here is the Radial Basis Functions 
Network (RBF). Following Hutchinson et al, I use the following architecture: 
j----1 
where U is the two dimensional input data vector consisting of the asset price 
and time to maturity. The asset price $ is normalised by the strike price of the 
option X. The time to maturity, t,, is also normalised such that the full lifetime 
of the option gets a value 1.0. These normalisations is the reason for considering 
options in pairs with the same strike price and time of maturity in this study. The 
nonlinear function b(.) is set to b(a) = v  and m = 4. With the nonlinear part 
of the network fixed, Kalman filter training of the RBF model is straightforward 
(see Kadirkamanathan & Niranjan, 1993). In the simulations studied in this paper, 
I used two approaches to fix the nonlinear functions. The first was to use the js 
and the E published in Hutchinson et al. The second was to select the/_j terms as 
random subsets of the training data and set E to I. The estimation problem is now 
linear and hence the Kalman filter equations become much simpler than the EKF 
equations used in the training of the Black-Scholes model. 
In addition to training by EKF, I also implemented a batch training of the RBF 
model in which a moving window of data was used, training on data from (n - 
50) to n days and testing on day (n + 1). Since it is natural to assume that data 
closer to the test day is more appropriate than data far back in time, ! incorporated 
a weighting function to weight the errors linearly, in 'the minimisation process. The 
least squares solution, with a weighting function, is' given by the modified pseudo

5 SIMULATIONS 
The data set for teh experiments consisted of call and put option contracts on the 
FTSE-100 Index, during the period February 1994 to December 1994. The date of 
maturity of all contracts was December 1994. Five pairs (Call and Put) of contracts 
at strike prices of 2925, 3025, 3125, 3225, and 3325. 
The tracking behaviour of the EKF for one of the pairs is shown in Fig. 1 for a 
call/put pair with strike price 3125. Fig. 2 shows the trajectories of the underlying 
state vector for four different call/put option pai
