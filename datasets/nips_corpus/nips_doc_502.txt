Abstract 
HARMONET, a system employing connectionist networks for music pro- 
cessing, is presented. After being trained on some dozen Bach chorales 
using error backpropagation, the system is capable of producing four-part 
chorales in the style of J.S.Bach, given a one-part melody. Our system 
solves a musical real-world problem on a performance level appropriate 
for musical practice. HARMONET's power is based on (a) a new coding 
scheme capturing musically relevant information and (b) the integration of 
backpropagation and symbolic algorithms in a hierarchical system, com- 
bining the advantages of both. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Neural approaches to music processing have been previously proposed (Lischka, 
1989) and implemented (Mozer, 1991)(Todd, 1989). The promise neural networks 
offer is that they may shed some light on an aspect of human creativity that doesn't 
seem to be describable in terms of symbols and rules. Ultimately what music is (or 
isn't) lies in the eye (or ear) of the beholder. The great composers, such as Bach 
or Mozart, learned and obeyed quite a number of rules, e.g. the famous prohibition 
of parallel fifths. But these rules alone do not suffice to characterize a personal 
or even historic style. An easy test is to generate music at random, using only

schoolbook rules as constraints. The result is error free but aesthetically offensive. 
To overcome this gap between obeying rules and producing music adhering to an 
accepted aesthetic standard, we propose HARMONET, which integrates symbolic 
algorithms and neural networks to compose four part chorales in the style of J.S. 
Bach (1685 - 1750), given the one part melody. The neural nets concentrate on 
the creative part of the task, being responsible for aesthetic conformance to the 
standard set by Bach in nearly 400 examples. Original Bach Chorales are used 
as training data. Conventional algorithms do the bookkeeping tasks like observing 
pitch ranges, or preventing parallel fifths. HARMONET's level of performance 
approaches that of improvising church organists, making it applicable to musical 
practice. 
2 TASK DEFINITION 
The process of composing an accompaniment for a given chorale melody is called 
chorale harmonization. Typically, a chorale melody is a plain melody often 
harmonized to be sung by a choir. Correspondingly, the four voices of a chorale 
harmonization are called soprano (the melody part), alto, tenor and bass. Figure 1 
depicts an example of a chorale melody and its harmonization by J.S.Bach. For 
centuries, music students have been routinely taught to solve the task of chorale 
harmonization. Many theories and rules about dos and don'ts have been de- 
veloped. However, the task of HARMONET is to learn to harmonize chorales from 
example. Neural nets are used to find stylisticly characteristic harmonic sequences 
and ornamentations.

3 SYSTEM OVERVIEW 
Given a set of Bach chorales, our goal is to find an approximation ] of the quite com- 
plex function x f which maps chorale melodies into their harmonization as demon- 
strated by J.S.Bach on almost 400 examples. In the following sections we propose 
a decomposition of f into manageable subfunctions. 
3.1 TASK DECOMPOSITION 
The learning task is decomposed along two dimensions: 
Different levels of abstractions. The chord skeleton is obtained if eighth 
and sixteenth notes are viewed as omitable ornamentations. Furthermore, if the 
chords are conceived as harmonies with certain attributes such as inversion or 
characteristic dissonances, the chorale is reducible to its harmonic skeleton, a 
thoroughbass-like representation (Figure 2). 
Locality in time. The accompaniment is divided into smaller parts, each of which 
is learned independently by looking at some local context, a window. Treating 
small parts independently certainly hurts global consistency. Some of the depen- 
dencies lost can be regained if the current decision window additionally considers 
the outcome of its predecessors (external feedback). Figure 3 shows two consecutive 
windows cut out from the harmonic skeleton. 
To harmonize a chorale, HARMONET starts by learning the harmonic skeleton, 
which then is refined to the chord skeleton and finally augmented with ornamenting 
quavers (Figure 4, left side). 
3.2 THE HARMONIC SKELETON 
Chorales have a rich harmonic structure, which is mainly responsible for their mu- 
sical appearance. Thus generating a good harmonic skeleton is the most important 
of HARMONET's subtasks. HARMONET creates a harmonic sequence by sweep- 
ing through the chorale melody and determining a harmony for each quarter note, 
considering its local context and the previously found harmonies as input. 
At each quarterbeat position t, the following information is extracted to form one 
training example:

The input consists of the harmonic context to the left (the external feedback H-a, 
H-2 and H_) and the melodic context (pitches s_, st and s+). phr contains 
XTo be sure, f is not a function but a relation, since there are many 'qegal accompa- 
niments for one melody. For simplicity, we view f as a function.

information about the relative position of t to the beginning or end of a musical 
phrase. strt is a boolean value indicating whether st is a stressed quarter. A 
harmony Ht has three components: Most importantly, the harmonic function relates 
the key of the harmony to the key of the piece. The inversion indicates the bass 
note of the harmony. The characteristic dissonances are notes which do not directly 
belong to the harmony, thus giving it additional tension. 
The coding of pitch is decisive for recognizing musically relevant regularities in 
the training examples. This problem is discussed in many places (Shepard, 1982) 
(Mozer, 1991). We developed a new coding scheme guided by the harmonic neces- 
sities of homophonic music pieces: A note s is represented as the set of harmonic 
functions that contain s, as shown below: 
Fct;. T D S Tp Sp Dp DD DP TP d Vtp SS 
C 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
D 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 
. . . 
T, D, $, Tp etc. are standard musical abbreviations to denote harmonic functions. 
The resulting representation is distributed with respect to pitch. However, it is local 
with respect to harmonic functions. This allows the network to anticipate future 
harmonic developments even though there cannot be a lookahead for harmonies yet 
uncomposed. 
Besides the 12 input units for each of the pitches st-, st, St+l, we need 12+5+3 =

determined at quarterbeat position t, becomes part of the input of the window at 
position t + 1. 
20 input units for each of the 3 components of the harmonies Ht-a, Ht-2 and Ht_, 
9 units to code the phrase information phrt and 1 unit for the stress sift. Thus our 
net has a total of 3 � 12 + 3 � 20 + 9 + 1 = 106 input units and 20 output units. We 
used one hidden layer with 70 units. 
In a more advanced version (Figure 4, right side), we use three nets (N1, N2, N3) 
in parallel, each of which was trained on windows of different size. The harmonic 
function for which the majority of these three nets votes is passed to two subsequent 
nets (N4, NS) determining the chord inversion and characteristic dissonances of the 
harmony. Using windows of different sizes in parallel employs statistical information 
to solve the problem of chosing an appropriate window size. 
3.3 THE CHORD SKELETON 
The task on this level is to find the two middle parts (alto and tenor) given the 
soprano $ of the chorale melody and the harmony H determined by the neural 
nets. Since H includes information about the chord inversion, the pitch of the bass 
(modulo its octave) is already given. The problem is tackled with a generate and 
test approach: Symbolic algorithms select a best chord out of the set of all 
chords consistent with the given harmony H and common chorale constraints. 
3.4 QUAVER ORNAMENTATIONS 
In the last subtask, another net is taught how to add ornamenting eighths to the 
chord skeleton. The output of this network is the set of eighth notes (if any) by 
which a particular chord Ct can be augmented. The network's input describes the 
local context of Ct in terms of attributes such as the intervals between Ct and Ct+, 
voice leading characteristics, or the presence of eighths in previous chords.

4 PERFORMANCE 
HARMONET was trained separately on two sets of Bach chorales, each containing 
20 chorales in major and minor keys, respectively. By passing the chorales through 
a window as explained above, each set amounted to approx. 1000 tr
