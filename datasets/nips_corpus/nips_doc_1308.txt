Abstract 
In this paper we propose a technique to incorporate contextual informa- 
tion into object classification. In the real word there are cases where the 
identity of an object is ambiguous due to the noise in the measurements 
based on which the classification should be made. It is helpful to re- 
duce the ambiguity by utilizing extra information referred to as context, 
which in our case is the identities of the accompanying objects. This 
technique is applied to white blood cell classification. Comparisons are 
made against no context approach, which demonstrates the superior 
classification performance achieved by using context. In our particular 
application, it significantly reduces false alarm rate and thus greatly re- 
duces the cost due to expensive clinical tests.

Incorporating Contextual Information in White Blood Cell Identification 951 
1 INTRODUCTION 
One of the most common assumptions made in the study of machine learning is that the 
examples are drawn independently from some joint input-output distribution. There are 
cases, however, where this assumption is not valid. One application where the indepen- 
dence assumption does not hold is the identification of white blood cell images. Abnormal 
cells are much more likely to appear in bunches than in isolation. Specifically, in a sample 
of several hundred cells, it is more likely to find either no abnormal cells or many abnormal 
cells than it is to find just a few. 
In this paper, we present a framework for pattern classification in situations where the 
independence assumption is not satisfied. In our case, the identity of an object is dependent 
of the identities of the accompanying objects, which provides the contextual information. 
Our method takes into consideration the joint distribution of all the classes, and uses it to 
adjust the object-by-object classification. 
In section 2, the framework for incorporating contextual information is presented, and an 
efficient algorithm is developed. In section 3 we discuss the application area of white 
blood cell classification, and address the importance of using context for this application. 
Empirical testing results are shown in Section 4, followed by conclusions in Section 5.

INCORPORATING CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION INTO 
CLASSIFICATION 
2.1 THE FRAMEWORK 
Let xi be the feature vector of an object, and ci - c(xi) be the classification for xi, i - 
1, ...N, where N is the total number of objects. ci  {1, ..., D}, where D is the number of 
total classes. 
According to Bayes rule, 
p(clx) = p(xIc)p() 
p(x) 
It follows that the with context a posteriori probability of the class labels of all the objects 
assuming values c, c2,..., cv, given all the feature vectors, is 
p(c, c2, ..., CN{X, x2, ..., XN) 
p(x,x2, ..., x;,) 
(1) 
It is reasonable to assume that the feature distribution given a class is independent of the 
feature distributions of other classes, i.e., 
p(xx, x2, ..., XN ]Cx, C2, ..., CN) = p(x [Cx)...p(XN Ic/v) 
Then Equation (1) can be rewritten as 
p(cl, c2, ..., CNlXl, x2, ..., XN) = p(xllcl)'P(Xivlciv)p(cx' c2, ..., cv) 
p(xl, X2, ...,XN) 
p(c Ix )...pen IxN )p(x )...p(x;, )p�, 2 ..., ;,) 
- p(c )...p( ;, )p(x , x2,..., x ;, ) 
(2)

where p(ci [xi) is the no context object-by-object Bayesian a posteriori probability, and 
p(ci) is the a priori probability of the classes, p(xi) is the marginal probability of the 
features, and p(xx, x2, ..., xv) is the joint distribution of all the feature vectors. 
Since the features (xx, x2, ..., x jr) are given, p(xx, x2, ..., x/v) and p(xi) are constant, 
p(Cl,...,CN) 
p(C, ..., CJVlX, 
= p(q Ix )...p(CN[XN)p(q, C2, ..., CN) 
where 
p(Cl,C2,...,CN)  
p(c, ..., 
p(C)...p(CN) 
(3) 
The quantity p(cx, c2, ..., cv), which we call context ratio and through which the context 
plays its role, captures the dependence among the objects. In the case where all the objects 
are independent, p(q, c2, ..., civ) equals one- there will be no context. In the dependent 
case, p(c, c2,..., cs) will not equal one, and the context has an effect on the classifications. 
We deal with the application of object classification where it is the count in each class, 
rather than the particular ordering or numbering of the objects, that matters. As a result, 
p(c, c2, ..., c2v) is only a function of the count in each class. Let Na be the count in class 
d, andva- /va d=l...,D, 
N' 
p(Cl C2 ... CN) 
p(q,C2,...,CN): p(C)...p(CN) 
NI...ND] p(v, v2, ..., VD) 
(4) 
= p(x, ..., vD) 
where Pa is the prior distribution of class d, for d = 1, ...D. 
D 
a= v = 1. 
The decision rule is to choose class labels a, a2, � � �, Ov such that 
D 
a:xNa = N and 
(,a2,...,Ov)= argmax p(Cl,C2,...,CNIXi,X2,...,XN) 
(c,�2,...,�N) 
(5) 
When implementing the decision rule, we need to compute and compare D v cases for 
Equation 5. In the case of white blood cell recognition, D - 14 and N is typically around 
600, which makes it virtually impossible to implement. 
In many cases, additional constraints can be used to reduce computation, as is the case in 
white blood cell identification, which will be demonstrated in the following section. 
3 WHITE BLOOD CELL RECOGNITION 
Leukocyte analysis is one of the major routine laboratory examinations. The utility of 
leukocyte classification in clinical diagnosis relates to the fact that in various physiological 
and pathological conditions the relative percentage composition of the blood leukocytes

changes. An estimate of the percentage of each class present in a blood sample conveys 
information which is pertinent to the hematological diagnosis. Typical commercial differ- 
ential WBC counting systems are designed to identify five major mature cell types. But 
blood samples may also contain other types of cells, i.e. immature cells. These cells occur 
infrequently in normal specimen, and most commercial systems will simply indicate the 
presence of these cells because they can't be individually identified by the systems. But it 
is precisely these cell types that relate to the production rate and maturation of new cells 
and thus are important indicators of hematological disorders. Our system is designed to 
differentiate fourteen WBC types which includes the five major mature types: segmented 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils; and the immature types: 
bands (unsegmented neutrophils), metamyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes, blasts, and 
variant lymphocytes; as well as nucleated red blood cells and artifacts. Differential counts 
are made based on the cell classifications, which further leads to diagnosis or prognosis. 
The data was provided by IRIS, Inc. Blood specimens are collected at Harbor UCLA 
Medical Center from local patients, then dyed with Basic Orange 21 metachromatic dye 
supravital stain. The specimen is then passed through a flow microscopic imaging and im- 
age processing instrument, where the blood cell images are captured. Each image contains 
a single cell with full color. There are typically 600 images from each specimen. The task 
of the cell recognition system is to categorize the cells based on the images. 
3.1 PREPROCESSING AND FEATURE EXTRACTION 
The size of cell images are automatically tailored according to the size of the cell in the 
images. Images containing larger cells have bigger sizes than those with small cells. The 
range varies from 20x20 to 40x40 pixels. The average size is around 25x25. See Figure 
3.1. At the preprocessing stage, the images are segmented to set the cell interior apart from 
the background. Features based on the interior of the cells are extracted from the images. 
The features include size, shape, color  and texture. See Table I for the list of features. 2

3.2 CELL-BY-CELL CLASSIFICATION 
The features are fed into a nonlinear feed-forward neural network with 20 inputs, 15 hidden 
units with sigmoid transfer functions, and 14 sigmoid output units. A cross-entropy error

interior. The red distribution is the distribution of the red intensity in cell interior.
