Abstract 
Information theory is used to derive a simple formula for the 
amount of information conveyed by the firing rate of a neuron about 
any experimentally measured variable or combination of variables 
(e.g. running speed, head direction, location of the animal, etc.). 
The derivation treats the cell as a communication channel whose 
input is the measured variable and whose output is the cell's spike 
train. Applying the formula, we find systematic differences in the 
information content of hippocampal place cells in different ex- 
perimental conditions. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Almost any neuron will respond to some manipulation or other by changing its firing 
rate, and this change in firing can convey information to downstream neurons. The 
aim of this article is to introduce a very simple formula for the average rate at which 
a cell conveys information in this way, and to show how the formula is helpful in 
the study of the firing properties of cells in the rat hippocampus. This is by no 
means the first application of information theory to the study of neural coding; see 
especially Richmond and Optican (1990). The thing that particularly distinguishes

our approach is its simplemindedness. 
To get the basic idea, imagine we are recording the activity of a neuron in the brain 
of a rat, while the rat is wandering around randomly on a circular platform. Suppose 
we observe that the cell fires only when the rat is on the left half of the platform, 
and that it fires at a constant rate everywhere on the left half; and suppose that on 
the whole the rat spends half of its time on the left half of the platform. In this case, 
if we are prevented from seeing where the rat is, but are informed that the neuron 
has just this very moment fired a spike, we obtain thereby one bit of information 
about the current location of the rat. Suppose we have a second cell, which fires 
only in the southwest quarter of the platform; in this case a spike would give us two 
bits of information. If there were in addition a small amount of background firing, 
the information would be slightly less than two bits. And so on. 
Going back to the cell that fires everywhere on the left half of the platform, suppose 
that when it is active, it fires at a mean rate of 10 spikes per second. Since it is active 
half the time, it fires at an overall mean rate of 5 spikes per second. Since a spike 
conveys one bit of information about the rat's location, the cell's spike train conveys 
information at an average rate of 5 bits per second. This does not mean that if the 
cell is observed for one second, on average 5 bits will be obtained--rather it means 
that if the cell is observed for a sufficiently short time interval At, on average 5At 
bits will be obtained. In 20 milliseconds, for example, the expected information 
conveyed by the cell about the location of the rat will be very nearly 0.1 bits. The 
longer the time interval over which the cell is observed, the more redundancy in the 
spike train, and hence the farther below 5At the total information falls. 
The formula that leads to these numbers is 
(1) 
where I is the information rate of the cell in bits per second, x is spatial location, 
p(x) is the probability density for the rat being at location , A(x) is the mean firing 
rate when the rat is at location x, and ,k - f ,k(z)p(x)dz is the overall mean firing 
rate of the cell. The derivation of this formula appears in the final section. (To our 
knowledge the formula, though very simple, has not previously been published.) 
Note that, as far as the formula is concerned, there is nothing special about spatial 
location: the formula can equally well be used to define the rate at which a cell 
conveys information about any aspect of the rat's state, or any combination of 
aspects. The only mathematical requirement 1 is that the rat's state � and the spike 
train of the cell both be stationary random variables, so that the probability density 
p(x) and the expected firing rate A(x) are well-defined. 
The information rate given by formula (1) is measured in bits per second. If it is 
divided by the overall mean firing rate A of the cell (expressed in spikes per second), 
then a different kind of information rate is obtained, in units of bits per spike .let us 
call it the information per spike. This is a measure of the specificity of the cell: the 
more grandmotherish the cell, the more information per spike. For a population

of cells, then, a highly distributed representation equates to little information per 
spike. 
Figure 1: Spot plot of the activity of a single pyramidal cell in the hippocampus 
of a rat, recorded while the rat foraged for food pellets inside a small cylinder. The 
dots show locations visited by the rat, and the circles show points where the cell 
fired--large circles mean that several spikes occurred within a short time. The lines 
indicate which direction the rat was facing when the cell fired. The plot represents 
29 minutes of data, during which the cell fired at an overall mean rate of 1.319 Hz. 
Consider, as an example, a typical place cell (actually an especially nice place 
cell) from the CA1 layer of the hippocampus of a rat--Figure 1 shows a spot plot 
of the activity of the cell as the rat moves around inside a 76 cm diameter cylinder 
with high, opaque walls, foraging for randomly scattered food pellets. This cell, like 
most pyramidal cells in CA1, fires at a relatively high rate (above 10 Hz) when the 
rat is in a specific small portion of the environmentrathe place field of the cell. 
but at a much lower rate elsewhere. Different cells have place fields in different 
locations; there are no systematic rules for their arrangement, except that there 
may be a tendency for neighboring cells to have nearby place fields. The activity of 
place cells is known to be related to more than just place: in some circumstances 
it is sensitive to the direction the rat is facing, and it can also be modulated by 
running speed, alertness, or other aspects of behavioral state. The dependence on

head direction has given rise to a certain amount of controversy, because in some 
types of environment it is very strong, while in others it is virtually absent. 
Table 1 gives statistics for the amount of information conveyed by this cell about 
spatial location, head direction, running speed, and combinations of these variables. 
Note that the information conveyed about spatial location and head direction is 
hardly more than the information conveyed about spatial location alonerathe dif- 
ference is well within the error bounds of the calculation. Thus this cell has no 
detectable directionality. This seems to be typical of cells recorded in unstructured 
environments.

The information-rate measure may be helpful in understanding the computations 
performed by neural populations. Consider an example. Cells in the CA3 and 
CA1 regions of the rat hippocampal formation have long been known to convey 
information about a rat's spatial location (this is discussed in more detail below). 
Data from our lab suggest that, in a given environment, an average CA3 cell conveys 
something in the neighborhood of 0.1 bits per second about the rat's positionmsome 
cells convey a good deal more information than this, but many are virtually silent. 
Cells in CA1 receive most of their input from cells in CA3; each gets on the order of 
10,000 such inputs. Question: How long must the integration time of a CA1 cell be 
in order for it to form a good estimate of the rat's location? Answer: With 10,000 
inputs, each conveying on average 0.1 bits per second, the cell receives information 
at a rate of 1000 bits per second, or 1 bit per millisecond, so in 5-10 msec the cell 
receives enough information to form a moderately precise estimate of location. 
2 APPLICATIONS 
We now very briefly describe two experimental studies that have found differences 
in the spatial information content of rat hippocampal activity under different con- 
ditions. The methods used for recording the cells are described in detail in Mc- 
Naughton et al (1989)--to summarize, the cells were recorded with stereotrodes, 
which are twisted pairs of electrodes, separated by about 15 microns at the tips, 
that pick up the extracellular electric fields generated when cells fire. A single 
stereotrode can detect the activity of as many as six or seven distinct hippocampal 
cells; spikes from different cells can be separated on the basis of their amplitudes on 
the two electrodes, as well as other differences in wave shape. The location of the 
rat was tracked using arrays of LEDs attached to their heads and a video camera on 
the ceiling. Spatial firing rate maps for each cell were constructed using an adaptive 
binning technique designed to minimize error (Skaggs and McNaughton, submitted), 
1034 Skaggs, McNaughton, Gothard, and Markus 
and information rates were calculated using these firing rate maps. As a control, 
the spike train was randomly
