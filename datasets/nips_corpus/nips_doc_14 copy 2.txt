Abstract 
Patterns of activity over real neural structures are known to exhibit time- 
dependent behavior. It would seem that the brain may be capable of utilizing 
temporal behavior of activity in neural networks as a way of performing functions 
which cannot otherwise be easily implemented. These might include the origination 
of sequential behavior and the recognition of time-dependent stimuli. A model is 
presented here which uses neuronal populations with recurrent feedback connec- 
tions in an attempt to observe and describe the resulting time-dependent behavior. 
Shortcomings and problems inherent to this model are discussed. Current models 
by other researchers are reviewed and their similarities and differences discussed. 
METHODS / PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
In previous papers,J2,3] computer models were presented that simulate a net con- 
sisting of two spatially organized populations of realistic neurons. The populations are 
richly interconnected and are shown to exhibit internally sustained activity. It was 
shown that if the neurons have response times significantly shorter than the typical unit 
time characteristic of the input patterns (usually 1 msec), the populations will exhibit 
time-dependent behavior. This will typically result in the net falling into a limit cycle. 
By a limit cycle, it is meant that the population falls into activity patterns during which 
all of the active cells fire in a cyclic, periodic fashion. Although the period of firing of 
the individual cells may be different, after a fixed time the overall population activity 
will repeat in a cyclic, periodic fashion. For populations organized in 7x7 grids, the 
limit cycle will usually start 20-200 msec after the input is turned off, and its period 
will be in the order of 20-100 msec. 
The point of interest is that if the net is allowed to undergo synaptic modifications by 
means of a modified hebbian learning rule while being presented with a specific spatial 
pattern (i.e., cells at specific spatial locations within the net are externally stimulated), 
subsequent presentations of the same pattern with different temporal characteristics 
will cause the population to recall patterns which are spatially identical (the same cells 
will be active) but which have different temporal qualities. In other words, the net can 
fall into a different limit cycle. These limit cycles seem to behave as attractors in that 
similar input patterns will result in the same limit cycle, and hence each distinct limit 
cycle appears to have a basin of attraction. Hence a net which can only learn a small

number of spatially distinct patterns can recall the patterns in a number of temporal 
modes. If it were possible to quantitatively discriminate between such temporal modes, 
it would seem reasonable to speculate that different limit cycles could correspond to 
different memory traces. This would significantly increase estimates on the capacity of 
memory storage in the net. 
It has also been shown that a net being presented with a given pattern will fall and 
stay into a limit cycle until another pattern is presented which will cause the system 
to fall into a different basin of attraction. If no other patterns are presented, the net 
will remain in the same limit cycle indefinitely. Furthermore, the net will fall into the 
same limit cycle independently of the duration of the input stimulus, so long as the 
input stimulus is presented for a long enough time to raise the population activity level 
beyond a minimum necessary to achieve self-sustained activity. Hence, if we suppose 
that the net recognizes the input when it falls into the corresponding limit cycle, it 
follows that the net will recognize a string of input patterns regardless of the duration of 
each input pattern, so long as each input is presented long enough for the net to fall into 
the appropriate limit cycle. In particular, our system is capable of. falling into a limit 
cycle within some tens of milliseconds. This can be fast enough to encode, for example, a 
string ofphonemes as would typically be found in continuous speech. It may be possible, 
for instance, to create a model similar to Rumelhart and McClelland's 1981 model on 
word recognition by appropriately connecting multiple layers of these networks. If the 
response time of the cells were increased in higher layers, it may be possible to have 
the lowest level respond to stimuli quickly enough to distinguish phonemes (or some 
sub-phonemic basic linguistic unit), then have populations from this first level feed into 
a slower, word-recognizing population layer, and so on. Such a model may be able to 
perform word recognition from an input consisting of continuous phoneme strings even 
when the phonemes may vary in duration of presentation. 
SHORTCOMINGS 
Unfortunately, it was noticed a short time ago that a consistent mistake had been 
made in the process of obtaining the above-mentioned results. Namely, in the process 
of decreasing the response time of the cells I accidentally reached a response time below 
the time step used in the numerical approximation that updates the state of each cell 
during a simulation. The equations that describe the state of each cell depend on the 
state of the cell at the previous time step as well as on the input at the present time. 
These equations are of first order in time, and an explicit discrete approximation is 
used in the model. Unfortunately it is a known fact that care must be taken in selecting 
the size of the time step in order to obtain reliable results. It is infact the case that 
by reducing the time step to a level below the response time of the cells the dynamics 
of the system varied significantly. It is questionable whether it would be possible to 
adjust some of the population parameters within reson to obtain the same results with 
a smaller step size, but the following points should be taken into account: 1) other 
researchers have created similar models that show such cyclic behavior (see for example 
Silverman, Shaw and PearsonI7]). 2) biological data exists which would indicate the 
existance of cyclic or periodic bahvior in real neural systems (see for instance BairdIll). 
As I just recently completed a series of studies at this university, I will not be able 
to perform a detailed examination of the system described here, but instead I will more 
299 
than likely create new models on different research equipment which will be geared more 
specifically towards the study of temporal behavior in neural networks. 
OTHER MODELS 
It should be noted that in the past few years some researchers have begun inves- 
tigating the possibility of neural networks that can exhibit time-dependent behavior, 
and I would like to report on some of the available results as they relate to the topic of 
temporal patterns. Baird[l] reports findings from the rabbit's olfctory bulb which indi- 
cate the existance of phase-locked oscillatory states corresponding to olfactory stimuli 
presented to the subjects. He outhnes an elegant model which attributes pattern recog- 
nition abihties to competing instabihties in the dynamic activity of neural structures. 
He further speculates that inhomogeneous connectivity in the bulb can be selectively 
modified to achieve input-sensitive oscillatory states. 
Silverman, Shaw and Pearson[7] have developed a model based on a biologically-inspired 
ideahzed neural structure, which they call the trion. This unit represents a localized 
group of neurons with a discrete firing period. It was found that small ensembles of tri- 
ons with symmetric connections can exhibit quasi-stable periodic firing patterns which 
do not require pacemakers or external driving. Their results are inspired by existing 
physiological data and are consistent with other works. 
Kleinfeld[6], and Sompolinsky and Kanter[8] independently developed neural network 
models that can generate and recognize sequential or cyclic patterns. Both models rely 
6n what could be summarized as the recirculation of information through time-delayed 
channels. 
Very similar results are presented by Jordan[4] who extends a typical connectionist or 
PDP model to include state and plan units with recurrent connections and feedback 
from output units through hidden units. He employs supervised learning with fuzzy 
constraints to induce learning of sequences in the system. 
From a shghtly different approach, Tank and Hopfield[9] make use of patterned sets 
of delays which effectively compress information in time. They develop a model which 
recognizes patterns by falling into local minima of a state-space energy function. They 
suggest that a systematic selection of delay functions can be done which will allow for 
time distortions that would be hkely to occur in the input. 
Finally, a somewhat different approach is taken by Homma, Atlas and Marks[5], who 
generalize a network for spatial pattern recognition to one that performs spario-temporal 
patterns by extending classical principles from spatial networks to dynamic networks. 
In particular, they replace multiplication with convolution, weights with transfer func- 
tions, and thresholding with non linear transforms. Hebbian and Delta learning rules 
are similarly generalized. The resulting models are able to perform temporal pattern 
recognition. 
The above is only a partial hst of some of the relevant work in this field, and there 
are probably various other results I am not aware of. 
DISCUSSION 
All of the above results indicate the importance of temporal patterns in neural net- 
works. The need is apparent for further formal models which can successfully quantify 
temporal behavior in neural networks. Several questions must
