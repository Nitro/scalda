Abstract 
A gradient descent algorithm for parameter estimation which is 
similar to those used for continuous-time recurrent neural networks 
was derived for Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models. Using mem- 
brane potential trajectories as targets, the parameters (maximal 
conductances, thresholds and slopes of activation curves, time con- 
stants) were successfully estimated. The algorithm was applied to 
modeling slow non-spike oscillation of an identified neuron in the 
lobster stomatogastric ganglion. A model with three ionic currents 
was trained with experimental data. It revealed a novel role of 
A-current for slow oscillation below -50 mV. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Conductance-based neuron models, first formulated by Hodgkin and Huxley [10], 
are commonly used for describing biophysical mechanisms underlying neuronal be- 
havior. Since the days of Hodgkin and Huxley, tens of new ionic channels have 
been identified [9]. Accordingly, recent H-H type models have tens of variables and 
hundreds of parameters [1, 2]. Ideally, parameters of H-H type models are deter- 
mined by voltage-clamp experiments on individual ionic currents. However, these 
experiments are often very difficult or impossible to carry out. Consequently, many 
parameters must be hand-tuned in computer simulations so that the model behavior 
resembles that of the real neuron. However, a manual search in a high dimensional

parameter space is very unreliable. Moreover, even if a good match is found be- 
tween the model and the real neuron, the validity of the parameters is questionable 
because there are, in general, many possible settings that lead to apparently the 
same behavior. 
We propose an automatic parameter tuning algorithm for H-H type neuron models 
[5]. Since a H-H type model is a network of sigmoid functions, multipliers, and 
leaky integrators (Figure 1), we can tune its parameters in a manner similar to the 
tuning of connection weights in continuous-time neural network models [0, 12]. By 
training a model from many initial parameter points to match the experimental 
data, we can systematically estimate a region in the parameter space, instead of a 
single point. 
We first test if the parameters of a spiking neuron model can be identified from the 
membrane potential trajectories. Then we apply the learning algorithm to a model 
of slow non-spike oscillation of an identified neuron in the lobster stomatogastric 
ganglion [7]. The resulting model suggests a new role of A-current [3] for slow 
oscillation in the membrane potential range below -50 mV. 
2 STANDARD FORM OF IONIC CURRENTS 
Historically, different forms of voltage dependency curves have been used to repre- 
sent the kinetics of different ionic channels. However, in order to derive a simple, 
efficient learning algorithm, we chose a unified form of voltage dependency curves 
which is based on statistical physics of ionic channels [11] for all the ionic currents 
in the model. 
The dynamics of the membrane potential v is given by 
Ci '- I- EIj, I.i = g.ia?bjq. J(v - vrj), (1) 
J 
where C is the membrane capacitance and I is externally injected current. The j-th 
ionic current Ij is the product of the maximum conductance gj, activation variable

aj, inactivation variable bj, and the difference of the membrane potential v from 
the reversal potential vrj. The exponents pj and qj represent multiplicity of gating 
elements in the ionic channels and are usually an integer between 0 and 4. Variables 
aj and bj are assumed to obey the first order differential equation 
 = k(v). (-x + x(v)), (: aj, bj). (2) 
Their steady states aj and bj are sigmoid functions of the membrane potential

where v and s represent the threshold and slope of the steady state curve, re-

3 ERROR GRADIENT CALCULUS 
Our goal is to minimize the average error over a cycle with period T: 
E: 7 (v(t)- *(t))t, 
where v*(t) is the target membrane potential trajectory.

which is an n-dimensional linear system with time-varying coefficients [6, 12]. In 
general, this variation calculus requires O(n 2) arithmetics for each parameter. How- 
ever, in the case of H-H model with teacher forcing, (8) reduces to a first or second 
order linear system. For example, the effect of a small change in the maximum 
conductance gj on the membrane potential v is estimated by 
Ct = -G(t)y - aj(7)PJ bj(7 )qJ (v(7) -- Vrj ), (9) 
(6) 
We first derive the gradient of E with respect to the model parameters (..., Oi, ...) = 
(..., gj, va,, sa, ta, ...). In studies of recurrent neural networks, it has been shown 
that teacher forcing is very important in training autonomous oscillation patterns [4, 
6, 12, 13]. In H-H type models, teacher forcing drives the activation and inactivation 
variables by the target membrane potential v* (t) instead of v(t) as follows.

4 PARAMETER UPDATE 
Basically, we can use arbitrary gradient-based optimization algorithms, for example, 
simple gradient descent or conjugate gradient descent. The particular algorithm we 
used was a continuous-time version of gradient descent on normalized parameters. 
Because the parameters of a H-H type model have different physical dimensions and 
magnitudes, it is not appropriate to perform simple gradient descent on them. We 
represent each parameter by the default value Oi and the deviation i as below. 
gj=jeJ, 
Then we perform gradient descent on the normalized parameters i. 
Instead of updating the parameters in batches, i.e. after running the model for T 
and integrating the error gradient by (11), we updated the parameters on-line using 
the running average of the gradient as follows.

+ 
Oi -- --/X,, (13) 
where Ta is the averaging time and e is the learning rate. This on-line scheme was 
less susceptible to 2T-periodic parameter oscillation than batch update scheme and 
therefore we could use larger learning rates. 
5 PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF A SPIKING MODEL 
First, we tested if a model with random initial parameters can estimate the pa- 
rameters of another model by training with its membrane potential trajectories. 
The default parameters Oi of the model was set to match the original H-H model 
[10] (Table 1). Its membrane potential trajectories at five different levels of current 
injection (I = 0, 15,30, 45, and 60yA/cm ) were used alternately as the target v*(t). 
We ran 100 trials after initializing i randomly in [-0.5,+0.5]. In 83 cases, the error 
became less than 1.3 mV rms after 100 cycles of training. Figure 2a is an exam- 
ple of the oscillation patterns of the trained model. The mean of the normalized
