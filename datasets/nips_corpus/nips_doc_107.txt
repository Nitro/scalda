ABSTRACT 
A self-organizing Hopfield network has been 
developed in the context of Vector Ouantiza- 
-tion, aiming at compression of television 
images. The metastable states of the spin 
glass-like network are used as an extra 
storage resource using the Minimal Overlap 
learning rule (Krauth and Mezard 1987) to 
optimize the organization of the attractors. 
The sel f-organizing scheme that we have 
devised results in the generation of an 
adaptive codebook for any given TV image. 
INllODUCTION 
The ability of an Hopfield network (Little,1974; 
Hopfield,1982,1986; Amir. and al., 1987; Personnaz and 
al. 1985; Hertz, 1988) to behave as an associative memory 
usually assumes a priori knowledge of the patterns to be 
stored. As in many applications they are unknown, the aim 
of this work is to develop a network capable to learn how 
to select its attractors. TV image compression using 
Vector Ouantization (V.Q.)(Gray, 19R4), a key issue for 
HDTV transmission, is a typical case, since the non 
neural algoritns which generate the list of codes (the 
codebook) are suboptimal. As an alternative to the 
promising neural compression techniques (Jackel et al., 
1987; Kohonen, 1988; Grossberg, 1987; Cottrel et al., 
1987) our idea is to use the metastability in a spin 
glass-like net as an additional storage resource and to 
derive after a classical clusterinq algorithm a 
self-organizing sheme for generating adaptively the 
codebook. We present the illustrative case of 2D-vectors.

For designing an optimal codebook, a clustering algorithm 
is applied to a training set of vectors (figure 2), the 
criterium of optimality being a distorsion measure 
between the training set and the codebook. The algorithm 
is actually suboptimal, especially for non connex 
training set, as it is based on an iterative computation 
of centers of gravity which tends to overcode the dense 
regions of points whereas the light ones are undercoded 
(figure 2).

will optimize the coding task. 
NEURAL NOTATION 
A vector of 2 pixels with 8 bits per pel is a vector of 
2 dimensions in an Euclidean space where each dimension 
corresponds to 256 grey levels. To preserve the Euclidean 
distance, we use the well-known themometric notation : 
256 neurons for 256 levels per dimension, the number of 
neurons set to one, with a regular ordering, givinq the

dimension 2, 512 neurons will be used, e.g. v:(2,3):

We extend the image space by defining a generalized 
attractor as the class of patterns having the same 
number of neurons set to one for each pixel, whatever 
their ordering. Such a notation corresponds to a random 
thermometric neural representation. The simulation has 
shown that the generalized attractors correspond to 
acceptable states (Figure 4) i.e. they are located at the 
place when one would like to obtain a normal attractor.

represented with arrows. In the left plot, some training 
vectors have no attractor in the image space. After 
generalization (randon thermometric notation), the right 
plot shows their corresponding attractors. 
ADAPTIVE NEURAL CODEBOOK LEARNING 
An iterative self-organizing process has been developed 
to optimize the codebook. For a given TV image, the 
codebook is defined, at each step of the process, as the 
set of prescribed and induced attractors, selected by the 
training set of vectors. The self-organizing scheme is 
controlled by a cost function, the distorsion measure 
between the training set and the codebook. Having a 
target of 50 code vectors, we have to prescribe at each 
step, as discussed above, typically 50/4.6 = 11 
prototypes. As seen in figure 5a, we choose 11 initial 
prototypes uniformly distributed along the bisecting 
line. Using the training set of vectors of the figure 2, 
the induced metastable states are detected with their 
correspondinq bassins of attraction. The 11 most 
frequent, prescribed or induced, attractors are selected 
and the 11 centers of gravity of their bassins of 
attraction are taken as new prototypes (figure 5b ). 
After 3 iterations, the distorsion measure stabilizes 
(Table 1).

CONCLUSION 
Using a classical cl usterin.q algorithm, a 
self-organizing scheme has been developed in a Hopfield 
network fmr the adaptive design of a codebook of small 
dimension vectors in a Vector Ouantization technique. It 
has been shown that using the Minimal Overlap 
prescription rule, the metastable states induced in a 
spin glass-like network can be used as extra-codes. The 
optimal organization of the prescribed and induced 
attractors, has been defined as the limit organization 
obtained from the iterative learning process. It is an 
example of learning by selection as already proposed by 
physicists and biologists (Toulouse and al. 1986). 
Hardware implementation on the neural VLSI circuit 
currently designed at LEP should allow for on-line 
codebook computations.

this study as well H. Bosma and W. Kreuwels from Philips 
Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, who have allow to
