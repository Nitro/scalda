Abstract 
Deformable models are an attractive approach to recognizing non- 
rigid objects which have considerable within class variability. How- 
ever, there are severe search problems associated with fitting the 
models to data. We show that by using neural networks to provide 
better starting points, the search time can be significantly reduced. 
The method is demonstrated on a character recognition task. 
In previous work we have developed an approach to handwritten character recogni- 
tion based on the use of deformable models (Hinton, Williams and Revow, 1992a; 
Revow, Williams and Hinton, 1993). We have obtained good performance with this 
method, but a major problem is that the search procedure for fitting each model to 
an image is very computationally intensive, because there is no efficient algorithm 
(like dynamic programming) for this task. In this paper we demonstrate that it is 
possible to compile down some of the knowledge gained while fitting models to 
data to obtain better starting points that significantly reduce the search time. 
1 DEFORMABLE MODELS FOR DIGIT RECOGNITION 
The basic idea in using deformable models for digit recognition is that each digit has 
a model, and a test image is classified by finding the model which is most likely to 
have generated it. The quality of the match between model and test image depends 
on the deformation of the model, the amount of ink that is attributed to noise and 
the distance of the remaining ink from the deformed model.

More formally, the two important terms in assessing the fit are the prior probabil- 
ity distribution for the instantiation parameters of a model (which penalizes very 
distorted models), and the imaging model that characterizes the probability distri- 
bution over possible images given the instantiated model 1. Let I be an image, M 
be a model and z be its instantiation parameters. Then the evidence for model M 
is given by 
PUIM) - / P(zlM)PUIM, z)dz (1) 
The first term in the integrand is the prior on the instantiation parameters and the 
second is the imaging model i.e., the likelihood of the data given the instantiated 
model. P(MlI ) is directly proportional to P(I[M), as we assume a uniform prior 
on each digit. 
Equation i is formally correct, but if z has more than a few dimensions the evalua- 
tion of this integral is very computationally intensive. However, it is often possible 
to make an approximation based on the assumption that the integrand is strongly 
peaked around a (global) maximum value z*. In this case, the evidence can be ap- 
proximated by the highest peak of the integrand times a volume factor A(zlI , M), 
which measures the sharpness of the peak 2. 
P(IIM) - P(z*IM)P(IIz*, M)A(zII, M ) (2) 
By Taylor expanding around z* to second order it can be shown that the volume 
factor depends on the determinant of the Hessian of log P(z, IIM ) . Taking logs 
of equation 2, defining E&! as the negative log of P(z* IM), and E!it as the cor- 
responding term for the imaging model, then the aim of the search is to find the 
minimum of Etot -Ede! + E!it. Of course the total energy will have many local 
minima; for the character recognition task we aim to find the global minimum by 
using a continuation method (see section 1.2). 
1.1 SPLINES, AFFINE TRANSFORMS AND IMAGING MODELS 
This section presents a brief overview of our work on using deformable models for 
digit recognition. For a fuller treatment, see Revow, Williams and Hinton (1993). 
Each digit is modelled by a cubic B-spline whose shape is determined by the posi- 
tions of the control points in the object-based frame. The models have eight control 
points, except for the one model which has three, and the seven model which has 
five. To generate an ideal example of a digit the control points are positioned at 
their home locations. Deformed characters are produced by perturbing the con- 
trol points away from their home locations. The home locations and covariance 
matrix for each model were adapted in order to improve the performance. 
The deformation energy only penalizes shape deformations. Affine transformations, 
i.e., translation, rotation, dilation, elongation, and shear, do not change the under- 
lying shape of an object so we want the deformation energy to be invariant under 
them. We achieve this by giving each model its own object-based frame and 
computing the deformation energy relative to this frame. 
This framework has been used by many authors, e.g. Grenander et al (1991). 
2The Gaussian approximation has been popularized in the neural net community by 
MacKay (1992). 
Using a Neural Net to Instantiate a Deformable Model 967 
The data we used consists of binary-pixel images of segmented handwritten digits. 
The general flavour of a imaging model for this problem is that there should be a 
high probability of inked pixels close to the spline, and lower probabilities further 
away. This can be achieved by spacing out a number of Gaussian ink generators 
uniformly along the contour; we have found that it is also useful to have a uniform 
background noise process over the area of the image that is able to account for 
pixels that occur far away from the generators. The ink generators and background 
process define a mixture model. Using the assumption that each data point is 
generated independently given the instantiated model, P(IIz*, M) factors into the 
product of the probability density of each black pixel under the mixture model. 
1.2 RECOGNIZING ISOLATED DIGITS 
For each model, the aim of the search is to find the instantiation parameters that 
minimize Esot. The search starts with zero deformations and an initial guess for 
the affine parameters which scales the model so as to lie over the data with zero 
skew and rotation. A small number of generators with the same large variance are 
placed along the spline, forming a broad, smooth ridge of high ink-probability along 
the spline. We use a search procedure similar to the (iterative) Expectation Max- 
imization (EM) method of fitting an unconstrained mixture of Gaussians, except 
that (i) the Gaussians are constrained to lie on the spline (ii) there is a deforma- 
tion energy term and (iii) the affine transformation must be recalculated on each 
iteration. During the search the number of generators is gradually increased while 
their variance decreases according to predetermined annealing schedule 3. 
After fitting all the models to a particular image, we wish to evaluate which of the 
models best explains the data. The natural measure is the sum of Eyit, 
and the volume factor. However, we have found that performance is improved by 
including four additional terms which are easily obtained from the final fits of the 
model to the image. These are (i) a measure which penalizes matches in which 
there are beads far from any inked pixels (the beads in white space problem), 
and (ii) the rotation, shear and elongation of the affine transform. It is hard to 
decide in a principled way on the correct weightings for all of these terms in the 
evaluation function. We estimated the weightings from the data by training a 
simple postprocessing neural network. These inputs are connected directly to the 
ten output units. The output units compete using the softmax function which 
guarantees that they form a probability distribution, summing to one. 
2 PREDICTING THE INSTANTIATION PARAMETERS 
The search procedure described above is very time consuming. However, given many 
examples of images and the corresponding instantiation parameters obtained by the 
slow method, it is possible to train a neural network to predict the instantiation 
parameters of novel images. These predictions provide better starting points, so the 
search time can be reduced. 
�The schedule starts with 8 beads increasing to 60 beads in six steps, with the variance 
decreasing from 0.04 to 0.0006 (measured in the object frame). The scale is set in the 
object-based frame so that each model is 1 unit high.

2.1 PREVIOUS WORK 
Previous work on hypothesizing instantiation parameters can be placed into two 
broad classes, correspondence based search and parameter space search. In corre- 
spondence based search, the idea is to extract features from the image and identify 
corresponding features in the model. Using sufficient correspondences the instantia- 
tion parameters of the model can be determined. The problem is that simple, easily 
detectable image features have many possible matches, and more complex features 
require more computation and are more difficult to detect. Grimson (1990) shows 
how to search the space of possible correspondences using an interpretation tree. 
An alternative approach, which is used in Hough transform techniques, is to di- 
rectly work in parameter space. The Hough transform was originally designed for 
the detection of straight lines in images, and has been extended to cover a number 
of geometric shapes, notably conic sections. Ballard (1981) further extended the 
approach to arbitrary shapes with the Generalized Hough Transform. The param- 
eter space for each model is divided into cells (binned), and then for each image 
feature a vote is added to each parameter space bin that could have produced that 
feature. After collecting votes from all image features we then search for peaks in 
the parameter space accumulator array, and attempt to verify pose. The Hough 
transform can be viewed as a crude way of approximatin
